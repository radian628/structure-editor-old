Four moons ago[a][b][c][d][e][f][g][h][i][j][k][l][m][n][o][p][q][r][s][t][u][v][w][x][y][z][aa][ab][ac][ad][ae][af][ag][ah][ai][aj][ak][al][am][an][ao][ap]...
_The orange-red sky of the setting sun shone through the trees, their leaves bright green with the start of new-leaf. Fresh, tall green grass grew on the ground, disappearing in patches of bare ground at the bases of some of the trees. Birds soared thr=ough the sky, endlessly gathering twigs for their nests, squirrels scurrying around for acorns. One squirrel stopped beneath the base of a tree, and began munching on a delicious acorn, oblivious to the danger nearby.
_A young tom stalked through the grass, his tail twitching impatiently. A cold burst of wind fluffed up his black and white patched fur, for it was only the very start of newleaf, but his pale blue eyes stayed firmly fixed on the squirrel in front of him. The tom got closer and closer, until the squirrel was only a tail length away. He pounced. The squirrel’s shriek of terror was cut short as the tom’s jaws crunched down on its neck. Nearby birds let out calls of alarm, and fluttered away into the distance.
_The tom picked up his squirrel, before warily looking around. Slowly and alertly, the tom began to walk. Inspecting eyes scanned over every bush, every hole, every log or rock or any other possible hiding place. Just as the tom was beginning to think he was safe, a loud yowl sounded, making him drop his prey and jump in terror.
_“OW!!!” a high pitched voice cried. “WHY ARE WE HIDING IN A BRAMBLE BUSH!!!”
_The tom stood stiffly, his pale blue eyes darting back and forth with panic.
_“Shut up, mouse brain!” an angry voice hissed quietly. “You don’t want him to hear us, do you!”
_“N-no…” the other cat whispered, his voice clearly showing his nervousness.
_Meanwhile, the young tom was trying to figure out how to escape. If he left, they’d follow his scent trail! He couldn’t let them do that!
_The tom’s breath came out in terrified bursts as he tried to no avail to stop his fur from bristling. Suddenly, the tom’s blue eyes opened wide, the panic cleared out of them. The tom’s gaze had settled on a dark mound of fox-dung beneath a tree in the distance. He could roll in fox-dung! That would make them think he’s a fox! The tom smirked, his pale blue eyes a mixture of mischievousness and satisfaction. That should scare those mouse-hearts away!
_But a flicker of doubt edged its way into the young tom’s eyes, which only increased as the tom tilted his head to think more carefully about his plan. They’d see him rolling in the fox dung… Even they had that much common sense… What could he do…? The tom’s eyes brightened as he formed a plan, thinking “I know what…”


/


_The tom got up and walked away from the bush, opening his jaws in a wide yawn. Suddenly, his paw hit something, and he found himself falling into a puddle of mud. The tom stood up, sending mud that was on his back sliding down his sides. His whiskers drooped, mud dripping from them. He shivered. Cold wind came out in bursts, adding to the coldness of the mud. He thought he’d never be warm again! Though soaking wet with mud and freezing, the tom’s pale blue eyes were filled with determination. This was worth it. Anything would be worth it.
_The tom waded through the freezing mud and onto dryish grass. His legs felt like icicles! Leaving a muddy trail behind him, he moved quickly through the trees and plants to where he saw the fox-dung. Feeling disgusted about what he was about to do, the tom pushed the pile of fox-dung behind a bush and began to roll in it. His plan was working! The cats watching him would think the fox-dung was mud![aq][ar][as]
_But the tom wasn’t done yet. He crept through the grass, making sure not to go too close to the bush the other cats hid in, and stood behind the bush behind them. From there he could just hear what they were saying. He thought he should listen because they might say something important.
_“Did you see him!” the cat who had called the other cat a mouse-brain laughed, almost forgetting to be quiet.
_“Yes!” The other cat purred. “It was so funny!”
_The tom tilted his head. There was something about the second cat’s voice, some small detail, something that made the cat sound like he was pretending to enjoy what was going on. Could it really be that this cat didn’t want to spy on him? Could it really just be that-
_The tom’s thoughts were interrupted when the first cat started mewing. “I dare you to claw his tail!”
_“No!” The other cat sounded horrified.
_“You’ve always been such a scaredy-mouse!” The first cat laughed, forgetting to keep his voice down.
_“But I was just thinking that-”
_“Scaredy-mouse! Scaredy-mouse! Scaredy-mouse! Scaredy-mouse!” The first cat interrupted in a kit-like way.
_“Scaredy-mouse! Scaredy-mouse! Scaredy-”
_The bush behind them rustled, and with a feeling of foreboding they turned around. The second cat shivered, and mewed, his voice filled with terror.
_“What was th-that?”
_“I-It’s nothing you sc-sc-scaredy m-mouse. You're a-always so- so sc-scared-d-d-d.” The fear in the first cat’s voice clearly contradicted his words.
_A loud bark sounded, and a terrifying, disgusting scent hit their noses.
_“R-RUN!!!” the other cat shreaked, and the first cat didn’t need to be told twice. They dashed out of the bush, a blur of black, brown, white, and silver, and disappeared behind some trees.
_The tom stepped out of the bush, and walked over to collect the squirrel he had dropped earlier. Before he went back home, he wanted to catch some more prey, and clean himself. Cleaning himself would be hard, he thought with a frown. He was covered in mud, fox-dung, thorns, twigs, and leaves. The tom turned his head to give a miserable glance at his fur, realizing he would have to wash himself in a stream. The tom sighed. At least he had escaped.


/


_The tom glanced warily around. The sun was almost completely gone, but there was still a blood red glow taking up a fourth of the sky. Clamped in his jaws were the squirrel he caught earlier, and two mice. Now was the time that he would have to be the most careful. If anyone saw him, everything would be ruined. In front of him, there was a large hollow, with a few trees, and a fast flowing river going past it. The edge of the hollow curved over a bit, partially hiding a clump of bramble bushes. Being extra careful that nobody was watching, the tom stepped into the bramble bushes, wincing as the thorns poked into his skin.
_Soon the tom found the wall of the hollow, which opened up into a cave, with many tunnels branching off of it. The tom walked into the second tunnel to the left, and walked along it for about a dozen fox-lengths, before coming to a dead end. Mossy rocks and boulders blocked the tunnel, telling the tom that the tunnel must have collapsed here long ago. Any other cat would have turned around, but the tom knew something that any other cat wouldn’t. This wasn’t a dead end.
_The tom moved a clump of moss away from the side of the tunnel to reveal a narrow tunnel, which he squeezed through. He turned around and pulled the moss back into place, just to be safe. Now he continued walking along the main tunnel, which forked off in two directions. He turned right.
_The tunnel floor was covered with jagged rocks. Every once in a while, a rock would block up most of the tunnel, and the tom would struggle to squeeze through. Finally, he got to a place where a big rock blocked the bottom right corner of the tunnel. The left bottom part of the tunnel had a much smaller rock, which he could easily climb onto. Right in front of the tom was a river. An underground river, that the tom suspected came off of the fast flowing river by the hollow.
_Most cats would just leap over the river, and continue on without looking back. But this tom was not most cats. The tom jumped down onto a narrow ledge, about two tail-lengths below the rock he had just been standing on, the river a tail-length below that. From what he did next, most cats would think he’s insane.
_The tom leaped head first into the river, claws outstretched. He dug his claws into the tiny gaps between stones, propelling himself downward. He pushed himself into a dip in the riverbed, which wasn’t just a dip in the riverbed, it was a narrow tunnel. The tom was washed through the tunnel into a much larger cave, where he ended up in a deep, water filled dip in the cave.
_The cave was about four or five fox-lengths in each direction, and three fox-lengths high. It was dark with mostly muddy, smooth stone surfaces. The dip that the tom was in was[at][au] about two fox-lengths deep, the water in it was about half a tail-length deep. The soil in the dip was mostly dry, showing it hadn’t been full in ages. Muddy paw-holds were etched into the sides of the dip, so that it would be easier for the tom to get out. But none of these details were important to the tom. What was important was on the other side of the cave.
_The tom scrambled up the last paw-holds, and ran joyfully to the other side of the cave, where curled up in a nest made of moss, was a she-cat with dappled orangish-brown fur. Four kits were curled up by her belly: a white-furred she-kit with black markings, a brownish orange she-kit, a brown tabby tom-kit, and a pale-gray tom-kit. The she-cat let out a purr, her forest green eyes full of love.
_“I brought food.” the tom purred, dropping the prey he held in his mouth. “I got the squirrel just for you.”
_The she-cat purred, and began to eat one of the mice, saying that she was going to eat the squirrel next, and that she was saving it for last. The tom settled down to eat his mouse, but before he could, the black and white she-kit mewled and sniffed the air, before scrambling to her paws.
_The she-kit fixed her forest-green gaze on her father and mewled again, before staggering toward him on her unsteady legs. When she reached his front paws, she gave up walking and curled up, purring.
_The tom looked at the kit, his pale blue eyes a mixture of love and sadness.
_“Do we really have to leave them?”
_“They’ll be safe.” The she-cat mewed, her eyes betraying her grief for what she was about to lose.
_“But what about Rustlekit?” The tom turned his head to the brown tabby tom-kit, his gaze fixed on the kit’s left hind leg. His leg was jagged, bending slightly forward, and then backwards, his paw twisted off to the right. Yet the little tom-kit acted the same as the other kits, struggling to learn to walk, as if he didn’t even know he was any different.
_“I’m worried about him.” the tom continued. “What if the other cats make fun of him? Will he be able to become a warrior?”
_“I think he’ll be fine.” the she-cat replied, her voice hopeful. “He learned to walk, just like the other kits, and he seems to be one that doesn’t give up.”
_The tom stared sadly at the ground. “I can’t believe that after today, we’ll never see them again.”
_The she-cat gave his shoulder a comforting lick. “This is for the best.”
_The two cats watched their kits for a moment, before the she-cat mewed:
_“Let’s leave at moonhigh.”




























Abandoned
_Ivykit blinked her eyes open. She was in the nursery, soft moss beneath her. Leaves surrounded her, barely visible in the darkness of the night. Queens and other kits slept around her. Everything was as it should be.
_But it wasn’t, Ivykit knew. There was something missing. Something she could only barely remember. Only the slightest glimpse. A cat. She couldn’t tell what he looked like, or anything else. Just his eyes. They were pale blue, with a caring, loving look in them. Was this her father? Ivykit longed to know more, but no matter how hard she thought, she couldn’t remember anything else. Her earliest memories were a blur of the leaves of the nursery, the soft moss beneath her paws, and, of course, the older kits’ never ending taunts and teasing.
_The older kits were asleep right now, but in the morning they would be awake, doing everything possible to make Ivykit and her littermates look horrible. Ivykit glanced warily at them, a bundle of silver tabby and pale gray fur. They were curled up by their mother, Shimmerstone. Shimmerstone helped take care of Ivykit and her littermates, but it was mostly Narrowstream who cared for them. Narrowstream was a pale brown tabby she-cat, her tabby stripes being almost black, Ivykit had noticed. Her only kit was three moons old, quite a lot younger than Ivykit. His name was Wolfkit. Wolfkit had dark gray fur with a white belly, paws, and muzzle. So far, Wolfkit had never done anything bad to Ivykit, but Ivykit didn’t put it past any cat not to tease her or play a mean prank. When they were only half a moon old, Ivykit and her littermates were found in ForestClan territory. They assumed her parents must have been rogues that abandoned them, and brought them in to grow up in ForestClan. But Ivykit wasn’t a ForestClan born cat, so the clan didn’t accept her. Almost every cat hated her and her littermates, and she hated them for it.
_Bored, Ivykit closed her eyes and tried to sleep. But when sleep didn’t come, a picture appeared in her mind. It was those pale blue eyes. What did her father look like? Did he have pale gray fur, like her brother, Whisperkit? Or maybe he had brown fur, like her other siblings? Another thought crossed her mind, the thought of it giving her a faint feeling that she couldn’t place. What if he looked like her? She imagined a black and white cat with pale blue eyes, walking over to her, giving her a lick between her ears… All Ivykit’s senses faded away as she drifted off to sleep.

_“Look!” a voice’s yowled, waking Ivykit up. “Sleepykit’s[av][aw] still asleep and it's sunhigh!”
_It was Silverkit.
_“I wonder what she’s dreaming about?” Hazekit mewed, her head tilted as if she were actually wondering that.
_“hmm…”Silverkit pretended to think. “Maybe she’s thinking about how rogues like her can’t be apprentices!”
_Ivykit stifled a whimper of misery. Why did every morning have to be like this?
_Hazekit opened her mouth to reply, but before she could, Rustlekit limped into the nursery, and hissed “We’re not rogues and we are going to be apprentices!”
_“Even if that were true, you can’t be an apprentice because of your messed up leg!” Silverkit growled back.
_“You can’t even walk properly! Hazekit added. “You’re just a useless furball!”
_Rustlekit just let out a hiss, not knowing what else to do. Ivykit whimpered, not even trying to hide her misery. What was the point? Not even Rustlekit could do anything to help. What was even worse was that other cats could do stuff to help, but they didn’t want to, they only wanted to make things even worse.
_Hearing Ivykit’s whimper, Silverkit smirked. “Look, the poor little kit is crying!”
_Hazekit made some comment, but Ivykit was too busy leaving the nursery to hear it. The camp was a grassy clearing, surrounded by a wall of mud and sticks with brambles woven into it. In front and to the right of Ivykit was the warriors’ den, a tall birch with a spherical den made of mud, sticks, and rocks at its base. A log was laid against the side of the den, so that cats could easily climb up it and onto the birch’s trunk and up the tree onto one of the higher branches. There was always at least one warrior up there, making sure that the camp was safe.
_This time the guard was a black tom with yellow eyes, who Ivykit recognized as Sparrowflight. Sparrowflight glanced down to give her a hostile glare, before returning his gaze to territory outside the camp. Ivykit glanced at the grassy ground, her forest green eyes full of misery[ax]. Another cat that hated her.
_Ivykit turned away from the warriors’ den and walked past the leader’s den, which was built around the roots of an oak tree at the center of the camp. A long, branch came out of the tree, about four fox-lengths above the ground. This was the High-Branch, where Sorrelstar spoke to the clan.
_Ivykit continued, and found herself in front of the apprentices’ den. The apprentices’ den was built just like the warriors’ den, except it had two small dogwoods instead of a big birch. Close to the top of the dogwood closest to Ivykit, two apprentices sat, sunning themselves in the warm sun of green-leaf. Rosepaw, a pale brown tabby she-cat, lay near the end of the branch, facing towards its trunk, while an orange tom named Herringpaw sat next to the trunk. The two apprentices were talking excitedly about something, and Ivykit shifted closer to hear.
_“...it was huge!” Herringpaw was saying. “Squirrelshade told me to take it to the elders! But guess what?”
_“What?” Rosepaw asked, her green eyes gleaming with actual excitement as she listened to what Ivykit thought was just another boring story.
_“It was so big they said they couldn’t eat it on their own, and that I could-”
_“Wait!” Rosepaw interrupted, her nose to the air. “I smell something!”
_Rosepaw turned around to glare at Ivykit, and lashed her fluffy tail, before curling it up in the air. This, Ivykit thought, made her look a lot like a squirrel.
_“What are you doing listening to our important conversations, rogue-kit?” Rosepaw growled. “Go back to the nursery, you useless pile of fur.”
_Rosepaw glanced at Herringpaw, as if she expected him to back her up, and he opened his mouth, trying to find the right words to say, but Ivykit was already leaving.
_Ivykit crawled away in defeat to her hiding place. Her hiding place was a small gap between the mud and sticks of the apprentices’ den, the bright green leaves of the nursery, and the muddy stones of the outside barrier. The gap was about three tail lengths in each direction, and Ivykit kept it hidden by keeping a muddy rock in front of it. Here she would be left alone.
_Ivykit sighed. What did she ever do to make everyone hate her so much? All she ever did was ignore their comments, sleep, eat food… That’s it! Ivykit’s eyes widened with realization, her eyes a forest of hatred. All these cats saw her as nothing but a senseless lump of fur, taking up their space, eating up their food! Ivykit’s eyes narrowed in confusion. Why did they only hate her and her littermates? What about the other kits? Why were they so different? Ivykit was about to let out a wail of pure pain, but stopped herself. What good would it do for every cat in camp to know her hiding place? Ivykit’s eyes took up a look of horror. Then she’d never be safe from the heartless taunts of those fox-hearted cats! Instead, Ivykit just buried all her thoughts deep inside her mind and forced herself to sleep.

_“Ivykit?!” a voice called out worriedly. “Ivykit, where are you?!”
_Ivykit blinked open her eyes. Narrowstream was looking for her. Quickly, but quietly, Ivykit moved the muddy rock and slipped into the clearing. Narrowstream came upon her at once.
_“Ivykit, where have you been?!” Narrowstream was much more worried than angry. “You weren’t in the nursery when I got back from the hunting patrol, and then you weren’t anywhere else in camp!”
_Not knowing what to say, Ivykit just followed Narrowstream into the nursery. Silverkit stood there, with a sly look in her eye, Hazekit and Shiverkit hovering around her.
_“Hi, rogue-kit, what-”
_“That isn’t a very nice thing to say!” Narrowstream scolded. “I’m talking to your mother about this.”
_But Ivykit knew that Shimmerstone wouldn’t be angry at them. She might even secretly be glad. With a glance outside, Ivykit saw that the sun was setting, and curled up to sleep. For now she had a break. But soon it would be morning… 
























Hidden in the Leaves
_Whisperkit yawned. The nursery was dark except for the faint red glow marking the start of dawn. Now was his chance. He could escape before the older kits woke up. But if he did, Narrowstream would be worried about him! He could just tell Narrowstream he woke up early and couldn’t fall back asleep… and that would be mostly true…
_Whisperkit stood up and stepped through the leafy entrance to the nursery. Naturally, his paws led him to the medicine cat den. The medicine cat den was a cave on the other side of the apprentices’ den. Right next to the cave, woven into the camp-wall, was a young pine tree. Some of the ground beneath the pine’s roots had been dug out to let light into the medicine cat den. Ferns grew in that narrow hole, making it the perfect hiding place for a kit that was interested in herbs. Whisperkit had been going there for more than a moon, and Dreamheart, the medicine cat, never seemed to notice him.
_Pushing his way between the camp-wall and the muddy stone wall of the medicine cat den, Whisperkit looked around in the mud for the hole. Finding it, he squeezed into the narrow hole through two roots and brushed his way through the ferns until he reached a wider area in the tunnel that bulged out to the left a bit. Whisperkit had widened it when Dreamheart had made a comment on how dark it was in the medicine cat den. He had realized that he must have been blocking the light, so he made sure that he wouldn’t block all of the light by widening the hole. From where he was, Whisperkit could see clearly into the center of the medicine cat den.
_Whisperkit heard Dreamheart let out a yawn, her dark brown tabby tail twitching as she woke up. She got up and walked over to her herb store on the other side of her den, and checked how much of each herb she had. Each herb was put in its own small hole in the ground. One hole had thinish yellow petals, which Whisperkit recognised as marigold. Dreamheart put marigold on almost every wound. Maybe it made the wound heal faster? Another hole was full of tiny black poppy seeds, which helped cats sleep. The only herb that wasn’t in a hole was the cobwebs, which were stuck on the wall of the cave above the herbs. Whisperkit looked down at the herbs again, wrinkling his nose at the sight of moss that was soaked in mouse-bile. He remembered that a long time ago, Silverkit had dared Hazekit to drink some of it, and she had ended up with a belly ache and a foul taste in her mouth that had lasted days. Whisperkit hadn’t exactly felt sorry for her.
_Dreamheart was pawing at some stems of tiny green leaved plants when Narrowstream came in.
_“Have you seen Whisperkit?” Narrowstream asked. “He wasn’t in the nursery when I woke up.”
_“No...” Dreamheart answered, still busy with her herbs.
_Whisperkit backed out of the hole, and headed towards the entrance of the medicine cat den. Narrowstream turned around and gave him a lick between his ears.
_“Where were you?” Narrowstream asked, her golden eyes flickered with suspicion as she eyed the bits of mud that clung to his pale gray fur.
_“I woke up early,” Whisperkit replied, his bright blue eyes innocent. “And I just couldn’t fall asleep, so I walked around camp.”
_“Then, I guess you must be hungry by now.” Narrowstream mewed, the look of suspicion vanishing. “Why don’t you get some food from the fresh-kill pile.”
_Whisperkit began to walk toward the fresh-kill pile[ay], which was right behind the leader’s den.
_“Make sure to bring some prey to your littermates!” Narrowstream called after him.
_Grabbing a mouse and a vole, Whisperkit made his way back to the nursery, knowing what he’d find.
_“Hi, rogue-kit, would you-”
_“Have you seen Ivykit?” Whisperkit asked, warily twitching his pale gray tail. “Or Tawnykit?”
_“You mean Sleepykit and Mouse-brainedkit?” Hazekit mewed, tilting her head to the side, her purple-blue eyes questioning.
_“Those mouse-hearts weren’t here when we woke up.” Silverkit mewed. “Maybe they decided to go back to their rogue parents and-”
_Whisperkit had already left. He knew where Rustlekit might be. Rustlekit liked to learn battle moves with Duskstorm, so he was probably somewhere near the warriors’ den. Bounding over to the den, Whisperkit sniffed the air, and smelling the fresh scent of his brother, stepped inside.
_Rustlekit was talking to Cloudfur, the older kits’ father.
_“...is on the dawn patrol.” Cloudfur was saying. “He’ll be back soon.”
_Rustlekit turned around, and then, spotting Whisperkit, rushed over to him.
_“You brought food!” Rustlekit purred. “Thanks, I’m starving!”
_“Have you seen Ivykit and Tawnykit?” Whisperkit asked.
_“No,” Rustlekit replied. “I’ll look for Tawnykit, you look for Ivykit.”
_And with that, Rustlekit, dashed out of the warriors’ den, leaving Whisperkit to look for his sister.


/


_“You can have the rest of it.” Ivykit mewed. “I’m full.”
_Ivykit walked away, leaving Whisperkit to finish the rest of the vole they had been sharing. It was getting close to sunhigh, and Whisperkit wanted to go to his hiding place before Dreamheart got back from gathering herbs.
_Whisperkit walked over to the medicine cat den and, with a careful look around, squeezed into the hole. Nobody had noticed him. Now all he had to do was wait.


/


_Dreamheart stepped into the medicine cat den, her bluish eyes tired, her jaws full of bright green leaves. Dreamheart set down the herbs and began to sort them, piling up different shaped leaves and petals of different colors. One thing Whisperkit recognized was rush, a long plant with narrow leaves. Dreamheart had tried to use it to straighten Rustlekit’s twisted leg, but it hadn’t worked. There was also a rather large pile of catmint, which Whisperkit knew was the only thing that could cure green-cough. But why gather a herb for a sickness that wouldn’t come for moons? It made no sense.
_While Whisperkit had been thinking, another cat had entered the den. It was Mewpaw, who had limped in, her gray-brown fur bristling as she tried to hide her pain.
_“Dreamheart,” Mewpaw mewed. “I have a thorn in my paw.”
_Dreamheart turned around, and examining her paw, mewed:
_“It looks like a big one. It must hurt.”
_Using her teeth, Dreamheart, pulled out the thorn. Mewpaw winced as a few drops of blood oozed out of the fresh wound.
_“Thanks!” she purred, and made as if to leave, but Dreamheart quickly stopped her.
_“I’m not done yet!” Dreamheart mewed, beckoning Mewpaw back over to her. “With a hole that deep, your paw could easily get infected!”
_Dreamheart smeared a poultice of marigold petals on Mewpaw’s paw. So that was what marigold was for! It stopped infections! Mewpaw winced and gritted her teeth with the sting of the marigold juice, the pain clear in her blue-green eyes. Dreamheart grabbed a cobweb and carefully pressed it down around the hole in her paw, before allowing her to leap out of the den as if her paw had already healed.
_Dreamheart turned back to her herbs. But as she worked, her right hind paw kept tensing up and untensing, as she normally did when she was thinking. Maybe she was thinking about the herbs she was sorting? It must be hard to remember all of them. But Whisperkit knew that Dreamheart never had to think that hard when sorting herbs. He’d never seen her paw twitch like that the other times when she was sorting herbs. What was she thinking about…?
_Dreamheart stopped, and with a glance outside, turned around. Whisperkit shuffled backwards with a surprised squeal as her purple-blue gaze settled on him.
_“I know you’re there, Whisperkit.” Dreamheart mewed, her tone soft and gentle. “You can come down now.”
_Whisperkit’s pale gray tail twitched nervously as he contemplated what to do. His eyes darted from side to side, clearly betraying his panic. He could run away and pretend he never came there. No, that wouldn’t work. Dreamheart would end up talking to him later. Running away would just make things worse. Also, she didn’t seem to sound angry or annoyed.
_With a glimmer of fear in his eyes, Whisperkit slunk through the ferns to the edge of the hole. Dreamheart gently grabbed him by the scruff and set him down on the ground. Whisperkit shuffled his paws nervously. What was she going to do? What was she going to say?
_“I’ve known you’ve been hiding in the light-hole for a while now.” Dreamheart mewed. “How much do you know about herbs?”
_The question took Whisperkit off-guard. He’d expected to be scolded and told to go back to the nursery, but instead Dreamheart was asking him about herbs?
_Shifting his paws nervously, Whisperkit mewed:
_“Cobwebs are used to stop bleeding. Marigold-” Whisperkit flicked his tail toward the yellow petals. “-helps stop infections. Poppy seeds help cats sleep. Catmint’s the only cure for greencough…” Whisperkit named many more remedies, all the while twitching his tail with nervousness.
_“How would you like to be my apprentice?”
_Whisperkit blinked, wondering if he’d heard her right. Be Dreamheart’s apprentice? That was what he wanted most in the entire world! And there he was, being offered everything he’d ever wanted, right then that moment.
_“Y-yes![az]” Whisperkit replied, his bright blue eyes gleaming with amazement as if he still couldn’t believe what was happening. He was really going to be a medicine cat!




































































Twisted
_Rustlekit bounced up and down impatiently in front of the camp entrance, awaiting the arrival of Duskstorm, Rustlekit’s favorite warrior. The camp entrance was a big hole in the camp-wall, next to the medicine cat den. Balanced on the top was a huge bundle of brambles, ready at any time to be pushed down on any enemies who’d dare try to enter the ForestClan camp.
_A slight sound alerted Rustlekit’s ears, the quiet thump of pawsteps. Was Duskstorm here?! Rustlekit was about to propel himself in front of the entrance with a purr, but a different scent hit his nose, making the purr dry up in his throat. Rustlekit hastened to move out of the way, but the hunting patrol was already stepping through the entrance. Stalkingleaf stopped just tail lengths in front of him, having come very close to tripping over him. Just behind her stood two other cats, Twigtail and Snowyshine.
_“Kits!” Stalkingleaf muttered to the rest of the patrol, as if Rustlekit wasn’t right in front of her, listening to what she was saying. “They’ve got nothing better to do than stand around in other cats’ way.”
_“Especially rogue ones.” her mate, Twigtail mewed absent mindedly, in the same superior tone.
_The cats walked past, dropping off their prey on the fresh-kill pile, before heading to their nests. As she walked away, Snowyshine glanced back to give Rustlekit a sorry and pitying look. Rustlekit sighed. It would seem like Snowyshine was just apologizing for her clanmates’ rudeness, but he knew it was more than that. Most cats in the clan hated him, and the rest pitied him for his twisted leg. Rustlekit’s fluffy brown tabby fur bristled. They thought he couldn’t be an apprentice! Rustlekit’s forest green eyes narrowed in a look of adamant determination. His leg wasn’t going to stop him from being the best warrior in the clan! Nothing would stop him!  Duskstorm was the only cat, besides his littermates, that understood that. If Rustlekit set his mind to something, he could do it!
_Rustlekit started pacing back and forth. When was Duskstorm going to come? He had gone out on the dawn patrol, and now it was way past sunhigh! Rustlekit couldn’t wait for Duskstorm to get back. He could just picture the tom’s fluffy dark brown fur, tinged with gray and a bit of black. He could almost smell his scent…
_With a jolt, Rustlekit realized that he could, in fact, smell Duskstorm’s scent! Rustlekit flung himself in front of the entrance, hopping up and down in his excitement.
_“Where were you?!” Rustlekit mewed, his forest green eyes shining with excitement. “Cloudfur said you had gone on the dawn patrol, but now it’s way past sunhigh!”
_“Needlefur,” Duskstorm flicked his tail toward the brown tabby she-cat. “Thought it would be a good idea to go hunting by the shallow-rocks during green-leaf, when the rocks would be burning.”
_“What a wonderfully amazing idea!” Duskstorm flicked his tail sarcastically.
_With a growl rumbling in her throat, Needlefur stomped away to the warriors’ den. Foxfur followed, Mistypaw trailing behind her mentor.
_Rustlekit didn’t care about those cats’ meanness. He was too busy jumping up and down and mewing:
_“Duskstorm! Do you want to see me hunt a mouse?!”
_“Sure!” The warrior purred, and followed Rustlekit to the middle of the camp, where he was dragging a stick.
_“Watch!”
_Rustlekit dropped down into a crouch, his left hind paw placed farther away from his body than his other legs. He had figured out quite painfully that having his twisted leg too close to his body would make him less balanced, and that if he fell over, he could twist his paw.
_Stealthily stepping forward, Rustlekit made sure to keep balanced, while not stepping on any twigs or leaves on the ground which might alert his prey. Now, only a tail-length away from the stick, he stopped. Pouncing on his prey would always be hard for Rustlekit, since only one of his hind legs could be used to pounce, so he had come up with a different way to trap his prey. Using his right hind paw, Rustlekit launched himself forward, and smashed his front paws down on the stick. With his prey pinned to the ground, he grabbed it in his jaws.
_“Wonderful!” Duskstorm purred, his dark blue eyes alight with satisfaction. “If that were a real mouse, it would be as good as crow-, no, cat-food!”
_“Now that you’re such a good hunter,” Duskstorm continued. “You should start learning how to be a good fighter!”
_Rustlekit’s eyes opened as wide as an owl’s.
_“You’re going to teach me battle moves?!”
_“Yes,” Duskstorm purred, his eyes clearly showing his excitement at teaching the eager kit. “But to start with, you’re going to learn a defensive move.”
_Duskstorm’s dark blue gaze traveled around the warriors’ den, before traveling through the rest of the camp, and then settling disappointedly back on the warriors’ den. What had he been looking for? And why was-
_Rustlekit’s thoughts were interrupted when Duskstorm called:
_“Snowyshine!”
_Snowyshine glanced behind her from where she was in front of the warriors’ den, before fully turning around and walking towards them.
_“Can you help me teach Rustlekit the duck-and-roll defensive move?”
_“Sure!” Snowyshine mewed, her purple-blue gaze settling sadly and doubtfully on Rustlekit.
_Rustlekit’s tail twitched irritably. He was going to become an apprentice! He was already better than the other kits! They didn’t even know how to hunt properly yet!
_“Snowyshine,” Duskstorm instructed. “You leap at me, and I’ll dodge your attack.”
_Snowyshine leapt, her paws outstretched and ready to pin Duskstorm down. But Duskstorm, as quick as a mouse, crouched down and rolled to the right.
_“Rustlekit, crouch down.” Duskstorm turned his gaze toward the brown tabby kit. “Now which way do you think you should roll?”
_Rustlekt thought about that carefully. If he rolled left, he would put weight on his twisted leg, which could cause problems. But if he rolled right, his leg would go up in the air and no weight would be put on it.
_Crouching down, Rustlekit rolled right. Trodden on grass flattened under him, and his hind left twisted leg went up in the air. Rustlekit landed with a thump, his left side hitting the ground, his legs sticking straight out like grass out of the ground. Duskstorm struggled to stifle a meow of amusement, and Snowyshine gave him a glare.
_Fur bristling, Rustlekit got up. He wasn’t angry that he’d fallen over. He was angry that Snowyshine thought it was his leg that stopped him from doing the move correctly. Did she seriously think that a cat should be able to do a move perfectly on their first try?! Did she do this move perfectly on the first try?!
_Ignoring his anger, Rustlekit started rethinking what he did. To get onto his paws, he would have to put more force into his roll. Crouching down again, he tried rolling, and this time he just barely was able to land on his paws.
_Snowyshine’s purple-blue eyes widened with surprise. Rustlekit had shown her. Now maybe she’d see that he wasn’t a poor crippled kit who’d never be a warrior! Duskstorm purred his approval, and suggested: “If you rolled left instead of right, you can use your right paws to help push you up onto your paws.”
_Rustlekit thought about the idea. It made sense. His two right legs were stronger than his left legs, since his hind left leg was twisted, so he might be able to get onto four paws more easily.
_Rustlekit tried the move over and over, each time getting more successful. Every time he landed on his paws, Snowyshine looked more and more astounded. Orangish light gleamed in the sky, marking the start of the sunset. Birds chirping filled the warm greenleaf air. Now, as he did the move one last time, he could tell that all of her doubt of his abilities had drained away. Maybe, if he proved himself capable enough, more cats would be able to see that Rustlekit really could become a warrior.






































Silver & Haze
_Soft, fluffy moss surrounded Tawnykit on all sides. Paws thumped closer to her, and she struggled to keep her breathing steady. Ever since Rustlekit announced that the clan was starting to think that he might become an apprentice, about half a moon before, Silverkit, Hazekit, and Shiverkit had been acting worse than ever, continuously taunting them, and when nobody was looking, even daring to claw them.
_Now, she hid, fearing that the older kits would see her. Tawnykit’s orangish brown fur bristled at the thought of the wounds those fox-hearts might inflict if they found one of them, trapped in a corner… All alone… 
_“What are you waiting for?!” Came a sharp voice, interrupting Tawnykit’s thoughts. “Let’s go and shred a few of those mouse-hearts!”
_Leaves rustled as the older kits exited the nursery. Shred them? Tawnykit shivered. She and her littermates would have to be careful, or they could risk more than a few tufts of missing fur.
_Tawnykit gave her sleek orangeish pelt a few licks before stepping outside. The sun was setting, a yellow-orange glow in the sky, illuminating the clouds in a bright pink color. Outside, cats were gathering around in different places, hungrily eating their prey. A few warriors sat on the top branches of the warriors’ den’s tree, watching the sunset. No one seemed to notice Tawnykit, but that didn’t bother her.
_Not being noticed could be a good thing, as well as a bad thing. If Tawnykit wanted to listen in on a conversation, she probably could, because no one would see that she was even there. But it wasn’t good when Tawnykit tried to speak up about something. Whenever she mentioned how bad those terrible fox-hearted older kits were, barely anyone cared. They just made excuses, saying that she was overreacting.
_Tawnykit slowly moved around the clearing. In front of the elders’ den, Treebranch and Eaglewing shared a rabbit. The elders’ den was between the nursery and the warriors’ den.
_“It looks like the prey is coming back.” Eaglewing mumbled around a mouthful of rabbit.
Treebranch flicked her brown tabby tail over his shoulder, and replied: “The prey’s been back since newleaf!”
_Quickly bored of the conversation, Tawnykit moved on, and found herself heading toward the apprentices’ den. She quickly rushed into a tuft of tall grass when she saw Rosepaw and her brother, Thornpaw, balancing on a branch. It was their favorite spot to sit, she had noticed, probably because they liked to look down on the other, younger, apprentices.
_From her spot in the grass, Tawnykit could see Mistypaw and Mewpaw’s similar grayish pelts. Herringpaw was sitting a bit further away from his sisters, eating a squirrel, and listening to Rosepaw’s bragging. Mewpaw clawed the grass irritably, her gray-brown fur slightly bristling.
_“Mistypaw caught a squirrel and a thrush, and I caught four mice!” Mewpaw announced, clearly wanting to show Rosepaw that she and her sister were as good as she was.
_“Well I don’t care!” Rosepaw spat, her green eyes gleaming with fury at the interruption. “I’m going to be a warrior soon!”
_“In only two entire moons!” Mistypaw whispered to Mewpaw with an irritated flick of her blue-gray tail.
_“She isn’t that bad!” Herringpaw hissed, and his icy blue eyes glazed twitching back and forth with indecision.
_“What are you mewling about?!” Thornpaw glared at them, his gray tail lashing. “You know we can hear you!”
_“Mistypaw,” Herringpaw flicked his tail at his sister accusingly. “Was saying bad-”
_“What is that -that thing- doing here?!” Rosepaw screeched, her green gaze settling furiously on Tawnykit. Maybe she wasn’t as invisible as she had thought.
_“Well what are you doing here?” Tawnykit asked calmly, stepping out from the cover of the grass.
_“Well, this is- we are- you should-” Rosepaw had clearly been caught off-guard by the question. “Just go away!”
_“Why?” Tawnykit blinked her forest green eyes innocently.
_Rosepaw and Thornpaw were bristling. Herringpaw was shuffling his orange paws uncomfortably, confused at what was going on. Mistypaw and Mewpaw were sneaking supportive looks at Tawnykit, glad that someone was finally standing up to the older apprentices.
_“This is the apprentices’ den!” Thornpaw hissed. “And you’re not an apprentice!”
_Tawnykit tilted her head, as if she was confused. “The apprentices’ den? I thought we were just outside of it?”
_“And that’s why you should get out of here!” Rosepaw spat. She was now shaking with fury, hating how she was losing an argument to a kit.
_“Why?”
_Thornpaw launched himself at Tawnykit in a bout of hatred, but she slipped to the side, scurried away into the clearing, and disappeared among the warriors. Those fox-hearts wouldn’t dare try to attack her with anyone watching, especially not with Sorrelstar watching.
_But as Tawnykit left one group of fox-hearts, she ran into another. She barrelled right into Hazekit, knocking her off her paws. Hazekit let out a growl and swiped a paw at her. Tawnykit gasped as sharp claws pierced her shoulder. They weren’t supposed to do that! Warriors aren’t allowed to attack cats from their own clan! Hazekit leaped to her paws. Tawnykit turned to flee, but Silverkit pushed her over and pinned her down.
_Half-sheathed claws pricked at Tawnykit’s throat, and she struggled to stay calm. Her shoulder was still throbbing, but she didn’t pay any attention to it. Would they let her go?  Were they going to claw her? Would they do something worse than that? Tawnykit stared up into Silverkit’s cold, unforgiving eyes, and tried not to think about the answer.
_Teeth clamped around Tawnykit’s scruff, and Silverkit let go. Now the teeth on her scruff started pulling. Tawnykit blinked in shock, confused and scared about the unprovoked and completely unpredicted attack. Those older kits had clawed her a few times before, and there was that one time when they trapped Rustlekit all alone and taunted him, but those were nothing compared to this! Shiverkit let out a whimper, alerting Tawnykit to her surroundings. Grass poked her back, and the surroundings disappeared into shadow. Where was she?
_The teeth around Tawnykit’s scruff let go, and Silverkit immediately put a paw on her neck again. This was not good. They wouldn’t move her into a shaded area, hidden away from sight, if they weren’t going to do anything bad to her. And from the look in Hazekit’s eyes, Tawnykit could tell that they were going to do something very bad indeed.
_From her spot on the ground, Tawnykit could see Shiverkit huddling next to her sister, her silvery pelt bristling with shock.
_“You- you tr-tried to a-attack Ha-Haze-k-kit-t!”
_Seriously? Did they really think that Tawnykit had been trying to hurt Hazekit?! She had just been running away!
_“I wasn’t trying to-”
_“Don’t listen to the mangy rogue!” Silverkit spat, covering up Tawnykit’s mouth with her other front paw.
_Fury surged up in Tawnykit’s heart. She hated these kits. What had she done? What had her littermates done? Nothing! They just wanted to bully them because they had nothing else to do!
_Tawnykit heaved herself upwards, but at the same time, Hazekit sunk her claws into her belly. Tawnykit’s yowl of pain was muffled by Silverkit’s paw.
_“Hazekit, what are you doing!” Silverkit shreaked, and Hazekit drew her claws out of Tawnykit’s belly. “Now there’s proof that we hurt her! We might get in trouble!”
_“B-But I- I- I didn’t know- I thought that- that I could…”
_As Hazekit tried to come up with a good excuse, all the older kits’ attention was on her. Tawnykit felt the pressure Hazekit was putting on her belly go down, and Silverkit shifted her paw that was on her neck a bit. Now was her chance to escape.
_Tawnykit bit down hard on Silverkit’s paw, rolled onto her paws, and began to run. Silverkit let out a screech and leaped backwards. But just as Tawnykit was about to clear the darkness of this hidden area, teeth connected around her tail, and she let out a screech of frustration, pain, fear, and mostly fury.
_“Help!” Tawnykit yowled, knowing she wouldn’t be able to escape. “Help! Silver-”
_Silverkit rammed into Tawnykit, knocking all the breath out of her body. Pain sprouted in her right hind paw as it hit the ground at an awkward angle. The two kits dragged her toward the camp barrier, and pushed her into it. Paws thudded from the clearing. Tawnykit’s green eyes gleamed with hope. A cat was coming to rescue her! Hazekit hooked a few bramble tendrils through her fur, just finishing as Narrowstream ran up.
_“Don’t say anything!” Silverkit hissed quietly.
_“Or you’ll be sorry.” Hazekit sheathed and unsheathed her claws.
_“Tawnykit!” Narrowstream ran up and started untangling her. “Are you okay?! What happened?!”
_“I-”
_“We found Tawnykit trying to escape the camp.” Silverkit mewed, an evil twinkle in her purple-blue eyes. “She was probably trying to find her rogue family out somewhere in the forest.”
_Tawnykit wanted to yowl and lunge at Silverkit in a fit of fury, but didn’t because if she did that, she would be giving all the cats that hated her some evidence to prove she was bad, she’d be giving them exactly what they wanted. It would be better to tell the truth.
_“I wasn’t leaving the-” Hazekit gave Tawnykit a vicious glare, and flicked her pale gray tail toward the clearing, right toward where Ivykit was eating a thrush. She gave the air just above the ground a quick slash with unsheathed claws. Tawnykit stared at her in horror. She really hoped Hazekit didn’t mean what she thought she meant.
_“I’m sure Tawnykit wasn’t trying to escape the camp…” Narrowsteam’s golden eyes narrowed in suspicion. “Nevermind what happened.” Narrowstream shook her head to clear it. “Tawnykit, you need to go to the medicine cat den. Those scratches look bad.”
_Tawnykit limped after Narrowstream. Her paw hurt with every step, from when Silverkit had pushed her over. Tawnykit turned around and her green gaze met Silverkit’s eyes. Was that guilt she saw? Or regret?
_“Tawnykit!” Narrowstream lashed her tail impatiently, and Tawnykit followed. Was it really possible for a cat as horrible as Silverkit to regret something? No, it wasn’t, Tawnykit decided, with a lash of her brownish tail. There was no forgiving what they had done.
_As Tawnykit followed Narrowstream into the medicine cat den, she came to a decision. All the bad things those fox-hearted kits had ever done flashed through her mind. The taunts, the tricks, the wounds inflicted, all of it adding up to fuel the rage that burned deep in her heart. Tawnykit’s green eyes lit up, like a forest on fire. Those fox-hearts would pay, and she and her littermates would have their revenge.








































Visions of Blood
_Whisperkit ripped a piece of rabbit flesh with his teeth, and began to chew the delicious meat. He was in the medicine cat den, where he and Dreamheart were sharing a rabbit. The den was mostly dark, except for the orange-red glow of the setting sun. He opened his mouth to take another bite, but an unnerving scent engulfed his nose, the scent of blood.
_Leaping to his paws, Whisperkit ran to the den entrance, Dreamheart following close behind. Narrowstream was walking toward them, her pale brown fur twitching with worry. Behind her, came Tawnykit. Blood oozed slowly out of her shoulder, and she moved with a limp. Whisperkit stood there and stared in shock. His sister was hurt!
_“T-Tawnykit!” Whisperkit gasped when he finally found his voice.
_“Whisperkit!” Dreamheart called, running over to Tawnykit. “Get some cobwebs!”
_Overcoming his shock, Whisperkit dashed into the medicine cat den and grabbed a pawfull of cobwebs. What had happened? What had made his sister bleed? Or… Who had made his sister bleed? Whisperkit’s blue eyes darkened, his pale gray fur bristling. Surely it wasn’t Silverkit and Hazekit? They wouldn’t do anything that bad, would they?
_Whisperkit rushed back to the front of the den, where Dreamheart was checking Tawnykit’s wounds. Narrowstream hovered over them, her golden eyes filled with rising worry as she saw how badly Tawnykit was injured. Bringing the cobwebs over, Whisperkit looked to Dreamheart for instructions.
_“Cover her shoulder and belly wounds.” Whisperkit padded cobwebs over Tawnykit’s shoulder and looked at her belly. Small spots of her soft orange belly fur were reddened with blood, but he could tell that it wasn’t too serious.
_Whisperkit stared at his sister. There was an intense look in her forest green eyes. It wasn’t pain… It was anger! Had it really been Silverkit and Hazekit?! And if it were… would his other littermates be safe?! Fear pulsed through Whisperkit’s veins. With a shudder, he imagined claws slashing at Rustlekit’s shoulder, or teeth clamping down on Ivykit’s tail. He had to make sure that they were safe!
_“I’m going to get Ivykit and Rustlekit!” Whisperkit stared pleadingly at Dreamheart, trying not to let the terror he felt show in his eyes. Dreamheart nodded, and Whisperkit ran off.
_“Ivykit!” Whisperkit called as he raced out of the den. “Rustlekit!”
_What if he couldn’t find them?! Whisperkit’s eyes darted back and forth as he looked over the clearing. Spotting Rustlekit’s fluffy brown pelt, he ran over.
_“Whisperkit?!” Rustlekit looked up from beside Duskstorm and Glistenfern, finishing the vole he was eating in a few quick gulps.
_“Tawnykit’s hurt!” Whisperkit gasped, his chest heaving from the run to the other side of the clearing.
_Rustlekit’s green eyes widened in alarm, and, with a quick glance at Duskstorm, ran over to the medicine cat den.
_“Have you seen Ivykit?!” Whisperkit asked hurriedly.
_Both warriors shook their heads. Whisperkit dashed off to the nursery, his heart racing. What if they were attacking her?! He slipped past Wolfkit, who was playing with his father, Blackclaw. There was no one inside the nursery.
_“Have you seen Ivykit?!” Whisperkit’s panicked blue gaze switched from Wolfkit to Blackclaw and back again.
_“I saw her going towards the apprentices’ den.” Wolfkit mewed quietly, his blue eyes wide.
_“What’s happened?” Blackclaw asked, but Whisperkit was already dashing off to the apprentices’ den.
_But in front of the apprentices’ den was Rosepaw, flanked by Thornpaw and Herringpaw. Rosepaw stared furiously at the pale gray tom-kit, her tail lashing. Whisperkit’s pelt was shivering with fear. Another, terrifying thought occurred to him, sending a sharp burst of terror through his heart. It could have been them, not the older kits, that had attacked Tawnykit! He looked around the clearing. Rosepaw mewed something, but he barely heard her. He was too busy staring at the cats in the clearing. Could Sparrowflight really claw a kit?! Would he and his littermates have to avoid Stalkingleaf for more than her harsh words?!
_Whisperkit had never been more terrified in his life. He felt trapped, alone, cats that could be dangerous enemies surrounding him. Whisperkit ran back to the safety of the medicine cat den, where he knew for sure that no cat would hurt him.
_Four pairs of eyes settled on him as Whisperkit bursted into the den.
_“I couldn’t find Ivykit.”
_Tawnykit’s eyes darkened. Rustlekit twitched his tail nervously, trying to understand why that was so bad.
_“I’m sure she’ll come back sometime.” Narrowstream mewed, oblivious to the danger.
_Dreamheart looked back down at Tawnykit, and Whisperkit followed her gaze. From the yellowish-green smear around the cobwebs that covered her wounds, he could tell that Dreamheart had already put a marigold poultice on her wounds. His gaze drifted to her paw. It was slightly swollen, but didn’t look too bad.
“Tawnykit has sprained her paw.” Dreamheart announced. “Whisperkit, could you and Narrowstream get some sticks and bring them back, while I make a poultice to bring down the swelling?”
_Whisperkit turned to go, but Narrowstream stopped him with a sweep of her tail.
_“Surely he can’t go out of the camp?” Narrowstream stared at the dark brown tabby she-cat. “He’s barely five moons old!”
_“It’s only a moon until he’s allowed out of camp,” Dreamheart mewed distractedly. “And you won’t have to go too far to find sticks.
_“I guess…” Narrowsteam mewed as Dreamheart turned away to get herbs.
_Whisperkit turned around and went out of the den, Narrowstream following him. Turning left, he stopped in front of the huge gap in the camp’s wall. Excitement washed away his fear. He was going to go out of the camp!
_Whisperkit stepped through. Trees stretched in all directions, their green leaves tinged orange by the light of the setting sun. Shadows dappled the tall green grass, and brambles and bushes were scattered across the forest floor. Birds chirped from far away, and Whisperkit looked up to see stars sparkling in the night sky. This was the forest, ForestClan’s territory.
_“Whisperkit!” Narrowstream slipped past him.
_He followed Narrowstream, out into the forest. Ivy draped off of a tall pine, a couple of sticks scattered beneath it. Remembering what he was supposed to be doing, Whisperkit grabbed a few sticks in his mouth, and motioned with his tail that Narrowstream should get more. After collecting some more sticks in her mouth, the two cats headed back into camp.
_Turning his head, Whisperkit stared out into the forest, wishing he could go back, but he knew he couldn’t. He went back into the medicine cat den, where Dreamheart was waiting.
_“Bite off the twigs and bark.” Dreamheart instructed as she pressed a cobweb down on Tawnykit’s leg, stopping the poultice that she had put there from being able to come off.
_Settling down on the sandy floor of the medicine den, Whisperkit began nipping off twigs from the sticks, the thin wood cracking easily beneath his teeth. Narrowstream and Rustlekit helped, gnawing off bits of bark until the sticks were smooth as bones. Rustlekit passed the smooth sticks to Dreamheart, who inspected them, placing them against Tawnykit’s leg to see if they were the right shape and length.
_Once he was done biting the twigs off of all seven of the sticks, Whisperkit slipped over to Dreamheart’s side to see what she was doing.
_“Can you move your paw so that it rests on the bend on this stick?” Dreamheart was pressing a bent stick next to Tawnykit’s leg, with the bent part being under her paw. Tawnykit winced as she moved her paw down into its position.
_“Is this a comfortable position?”
_Tawnykit nodded, and Dreamheart pressed another bent stick on the other side of her leg. But the stick didn’t fit correctly because it wasn’t bent enough. Dreamheart turned her head to look at Whisperkit.
_“If you bite a part of the stick, it will be easier to bend.” Dreamheart told him, rolling the stick over to him. “To make it stronger, you could wrap cobwebs around it.”
_Whisperkit followed her instructions, biting the stick and wrapping it in cobwebs. Dreamheart took two other sticks, and Whisperkit held them in place around Tawnykit’s leg while Dreamheart tightly bound it with cobwebs.
_“Now,” Dreamheart mewed, getting to her paws. “What were you doing by the camp-wall?”
_“I wasn’t-” Tawnykit broke off, her forest green gaze flickering toward something outside the den. Whisperkit followed her gaze. A pale gray figure was standing on the other side of the camp clearing. It was Hazekit. She lashed her claws across the ground, her bluish eyes gleaming with hatred.
_Whisperkit turned back to Tawnykit, whose brown tinged pelt was shivering with fear.
_“I wasn’t trying to leave camp,” Tawnykit continued. “I-I was just looking for a good place to eat a mouse.”
_Narrowstream flicked her tail, looking like she didn’t believe it. Dreamheart’s purple-blue eyes were full of doubt.
_“Fine!” Tawnykit mewed, with a flick of her brown tipped tail. “That wasn’t what I was doing! But it isn’t fair that I can’t go out of camp! I was trying to get through a hole in the wall, but when I tried to get through, my leg got caught, and it hurt, so I tried to go back, but my fur was stuck in the thorns.”
_Whisperkit looked back toward Hazekit, but what he saw made his blood turn to ice. It wasn’t Hazekit that he saw, but Shiverkit. Her silver tabby fur was streaked with blood, an ominous red light lighting her up against a dark background lost in shadow. Her blue eyes glinted with cruelty, and her unsheathed claws were long and sharp, tearing ruthlessly at the grass beneath her paws. The stench of blood swirled around Whisperkit, making him dizzy. Shiverkit turned her head and fixed her evil gaze on him. Terror jolted through him, sending his fur on end.
_Whisperkit blinked his eyes, hoping the dreadful sight would go away. Suddenly, Shiverkit wasn’t a blood covered evil creature of hatred. The blood on her fur wasn’t blood, but mud turned red by the light of the setting sun. Her claws were an average length, her eyes not so much cruel as anxious and uncertain. She was just a normal kit, a scared kit.
_Relief flooded across his pelt, and for a moment, he wondered if he had imagined Shiverkit’s evilness. She was usually scared of them, not the other way around. But fear prickled in his fur, and with a horrifying certainty, Whisperkit realized that it wasn’t an illusion he had seen, but a vision.
















































Spy
_Ivykit plucked the brown and white feathers off of the thrush she was eating. Was the thrush all feathers? She flicked her black tail irritably, letting her whiskers droop. Why did everything have to go wrong?
_Fur prickled on Ivykit’s back. Someone was watching her. Ivykit turned her head to look behind her, and saw the orangish light glinting off of Hazekit’s eyes. Misery washed over her. Why couldn’t those fox-hearts just leave her alone?! At least they weren’t coming over to annoy her. Her white and black fur bristled with fear. Her littermates had been telling her that Silverkit and Hazekit had started clawing them, so she had started hiding in her hiding place more and more often, sometimes hiding there for entire days.
_A desperate yowl broke through her thoughts: “Help! Help! Silver-”
_The yowl ended in a screech of pain, making Ivykit almost choke on a piece of thrush as she swallowed it. Panic clouded her thoughts. She had to get out of there! She had to go to her hiding place! Ivykit began gulping down thrush meat hurriedly, barely noticing as Narrowstream ran past her.
_When she had finally finished her thrush, Ivykit dashed into the nursery, and ran into the corner of the den. Over the past quarter moon, she had been clearing away stems and twigs from the corner of the den, leaving only a thin layer of leaves that lead right into her hiding spot. That way, she could go into her hiding spot from the nursery, and she couldn’t be trapped in there unless she was blocked on both entrances.
_Now, curled up inside her hiding place, Ivykit waited. It wouldn’t be long before the older kits went to sleep, when she would be safe.
_Ivykit froze as she heard a voice, terrifyingly close to where she was hiding.
_“Never mind what happened. Tawnykit, you need to go to the medicine cat den. Those scratches look bad.”
_Was that Narrowstream? And what had happened to Tawnykit?! Curiosity mixed with the fear in Ivykit’s mind. Paws thumped against the ground, getting quieter and quieter as Narrowstream and Tawnykit walked away.
_What was going on?! What had happened?! Terror jolted through her as another voice sounded, right outside the sticks and stones that surrounded Ivykit’s hiding place.
_“Hazekit, go after them. Make sure Tawnykit lies about how she got hurt.”
_Ivykit didn’t recognize the voice, but she thought it must be one of the older kits. Sniffing the air, she could smell Silverkit and Shiverkit, along with the fresh scent of Hazekit. Ivykit’s fur bristled with fear as she realized that the only thing that hid her from Silverkit was a thin barrier of mud and twigs.
_“A-Are you s-sure that we d-did the r-right thi-thing?” Ivykit assumed that it was Shiverkit who mewed that from the nervousness of her voice.
_“Of course we did the right thing!” The first cat, who Ivykit thought was Silverkit, spat. “Those fox-hearted rogue kits don’t deserve to be in ForestClan!”
_“N-No, you’re r-r-right.” Shiverkit sounded scared. “They d-don’t.”
_Ivykit blinked in confusion. Shiverkit shouldn’t be scared of Silverkit! Silverkit and Hazekit looked after her and protected her! And what did they mean by ‘the right thing’? Fear coursed down Ivykit’s spine. Tawnykit’s scratches… Doing the right thing… They had attacked Tawnykit! But why would Shiverkit be uncertain about whether to attack Tawnykit or not? Was it possible that she didn’t want to attack Tawnykit? That she didn’t hate them for not being born in the clan? Maybe not every cat hated her? Hope seared Ivykit’s heart, but quickly broke down into misery. Every cat hated them! It was impossible! But what if-
_“Ivykit?!” Whisperkit’s panicked mew broke through her thoughts. “Ivykit, where are you?!”
_Paws thudded close to her, and through a tiny gap in the thin layer of leaves in the wall of her hiding place, Ivykit could see her brother’s pelt, a lighter pale gray against a background of shaded leaves. Whisperkit was inside the nursery, looking around frantically. Maybe she should come out? But then she wouldn’t be able to spy on the older kits! Ivykit’s black tail tip twitched with confusion. Was she spying on them? Or was she hiding? Or was she hiding so that she could spy on them? She was listening to what they were saying, so… Was she spying on them? 
_Silverkit and Shiverkit started talking about something, and Ivykit was faintly aware of Whisperkit asking someone: “Have you seen Ivykit?!”, but she was so confused that she barely heard.
_Was she spying? Was she hiding? Should she be listening to Silverkit and Shiverkit? Was her hiding spot safe? Should she go somewhere else? Should she go with Whisperkit? Why was he so terrified? Ivykit let out a mewl of confusion.
_Suddenly, everything was quiet. Silverkit and Shiverkit had stopped talking. Whisperkit had gone. Even the birds had seemed to stop chirping. Ivykit sunk back even further into the wall of the camp barrier, her heart pounding. Had they heard her?! In the silence, she could hear the sound of a cat sniffing the air. Should she run?! Should she hide?!
_“I think that Ivykit’s been here…” Silverkit’s terrifying voice sounded right next to her ear. “Or is she still here…?”
_Ivykit pelted through the leaves and into the nursery. Blackclaw turned around from where he had been playing with Wolfkit near the entrance of the nursery, his fluffy black fur slightly puffed up. She ducked down behind a clump of moss, her white and black fur fluffing up with terror as he started to move into the den.
_Suddenly, a loud thump sounded. Ivykit peered out from behind the moss to see Wolfkit standing behind Blackclaw, his paws pinning down his father’s tail.
_“Wolfkit!” Blackclaw purred, turning to go back outside.
_But as Wolfkit followed him, he turned around, fixing his blue gaze on Ivykit. Ivykit burrowed deeper into the moss as Wolfkit turned away, following Blackclaw outside.
_Ivykit shivered. Would Wolfkit tell anyone where she was hiding? Or would he keep it a secret? She assumed that he wouldn’t keep it a secret. Every cat hated her! Of course he would tell on her! It would be safer to go back to her hiding spot.
_Ivykit slipped back through the leaves into her dark, shaded hiding spot. Outside, she could hear Silverkit and Shiverkit arguing.
_“Wh-What I m-m-mean is that T-Tawnykit might not have been trying to a-attack H-Hazekit.” Shiverkit’s nervous voice mewed quietly, her voice almost drowned out by the playful squeaks of Wolfkit, who Ivykit assumed was still outside the nursery.
_“Of course that fox-hearted rogue was trying to attack her!” Silverkit spat, and Ivykit heard a faint whimper as Shiverkit moved away from her sister. “Didn’t you smell her fear-scent?!” Ivykit shrunk back further into her hiding spot, thorns pricking her fluffed up pelt. “She was terrified!”
_But Hazekit was the worst out of all of them! How could she be scared of them?! With a shudder, Ivykit imagined the pale gray she-kit, her purple-blue eyes sparkling with cruelty. There was no way that she was scared of them!
“I wonder what’s taking her so long?” Silverkit’s voice lowered to a low growl. “I’m going to go and find her.
_Ivykit nudged the mud-covered stone that covered her hiding spot with a paw, leaving a very tiny hole for her to peer out of. Outside, she could see Silverkit’s silver tabby back as she walked away. Crouching in the shadows in front of her, she could see Shiverkit.
_Shiverkit turned her head to look away from her sister, her purple-blue eyes full of confusion and misery. But there was something wrong about the cat Ivykit saw, and with a sharp burst of shock, she realized that Shiverkit had blue eyes, not purple-blue eyes. It was Silverkit who was hiding there, full of confusion and fear, not Shiverkit! It wasn’t Silverkit who was the horrible leader of the three older kits, causing Ivykit and her littermates endless terror and misery, it was her sister, Shiverkit.

_A wail sounded the arrival of Hazekit.
_“Silverkit!”
_The two kits huddled together in the darkness. The sun had almost set now, the only light a faint red glow. Silverkit’s mew broke the silence.
_“Do you think we did the right thing?”
_“I-I don’t know.” Hazekit replied. “T-Tawnykit didn’t seem to be trying to h-hurt me.”
_“They n-never seemed to w-want to h-hurt us…” Silverkit mewed. “Maybe if we left them alone, they’d leave us alone.”
_“Then we should leave them alone.” Hazekit agreed. “But what about Shiverkit…”
_Ivykit saw Silverkit shiver. How could a cat be scared of her own sister?
_“I just wish she’d leave us alone!” Hazekit’s voice broke into a wail. “I just want to stay away from those rogues, but she won’t let me!”
_For the first time in her life, Ivykit felt sorry for them. Shiverkit was being just as terrible to her sisters as she was to Ivykit and her littermates. But there was no way to stop that terrible cat…
_Ivykit slipped out of her hiding spot and into the nursery. Inside, Shiverkit was curled up in a pile of moss, Narrowstream and Wolfkit asleep nearby. But where were her littermates?!
_Ivykit rushed out of the nursery and into the clearing.
“Ivykit!” turning her head, Ivykit spotted a brownish figure limping toward her from the medicine cat den. Ivykit ran past Rustlekit into the den. Dreamheart was curled up in her nest, asleep. Whisperkit was also sleeping, curled up on the bare ground as if he had collapsed with exhaustion. Tawnykit lay on a pile of moss, cobwebs plastered on her shoulder, leg, and belly. Ivykit shivered at the thought that the older kits had done that. She had imagined maybe one claw wound, or bite mark.
_Rustlekit stepped into the den next to her. Tawnykit blinked open her forest green eyes, starting to wake up.
_“Ivykit? Rustlekit?” Tawnykit asked confusedly. “Wh-Where am I?”
_“You’re in the medicine cat den.” Rustlekit answered quietly.
_Tawnykit blinked and her green eyes widened.
_“Wake Whisperkit.” Tawnykit turned her head to look at their brother.
_Rustlekit stepped forward and nudged Whisperkit with a paw.
_“Wh-what?” Whisperkit stood up, his blue eyes still full of sleepiness.
_Tawnykit struggled to sit up on her moss, her brownish-orange fur bristling with anger.
_“It was Silverkit and Hazekit!” she finally spat.
_“No, it wasn’t.” Three pairs of eyes turned to look at Ivykit.
_“It was all Shiverkit.”
_Whisperkit shuddered, as if he were remembering something terrible.
_“I saw them hiding in the gap between the apprentices’ den and the nursery, after you left.” Ivykit continued. “Shiverkit started ordering them around, telling Hazekit to watch you and started arguing with Silverkit. Silverkit sounded terrified of her. After Shiverkit left, Hazekit came back, and they started talking about how they didn’t like doing what Shiverkit said, and how they were scared of us.”
_“B-But I thought Silverkit was their leader?!” Rustlekit tilted his head confusedly, his tail tip twitching. “And isn’t Hazekit the worst out of all of them?! How is she scared of us?!”
_“I don’t know.” Ivykit mewed. “Maybe they were pretending, because Shiverkit told them to?”
_“It doesn’t matter why they did what they did.” Tawnykit spoke clearly through the night air, her green eyes glowing intensely in the darkness. “We have to stop them.”
_Ivykit shivered. What did she mean?
_“What we need is a plan.”






















The Plan
_Tawnykit’s littermates stared at her. Rustlekit was the first to speak.
_“What’s the plan?!” He mewed excitedly, a little too loudly. Dreamheart mumbled something in her sleep, but didn’t wake up.
_“A-Are you sure this is a good idea?” Ivykit mewed doubtfully. “Wouldn’t it just make Shiverkit hate us more and be worse to us?”
_“This isn’t just going to be revenge.” Tawnykit mewed, wincing as she tried to get to her paws. “We’re going to scare Shiverkit into leaving us alone.”
_“But how?!” Whisperkit’s eyes were wide with fear, but still determined. “Is it even possible to scare her?”
_“Every cat is afraid of something.” Tawnykit mewed, trying to hide the doubt she felt. “We just need to find out what scares her.”
_“I- I still don’t think this is a good idea.” Ivykit’s tail twitched nervously, her pelt fluffing up with fear.
_“But we can’t just wait around for her to stop!” Tawnykit argued. “Because she won’t. We have to do something!”
_“O-Okay.” Ivykit’s tail twitched nervously.
_“So, what is the plan?” Whisperkit asked, stepping forward.
_“I don’t know.” Tawnykit realized how hopeless her idea sounded. They were just four kits trying to make a crazy plan to make a cat so evil she controlled her sisters using fear leave them alone. There was no way anything they could do would work.
_“Maybe this is a bad idea.” Tawnykit stared at the dusty ground.
_“We shouldn’t just give up!” Rustlekit mewed determinedly. “We have to do something!”
_“This is a bad idea.” Ivykit mewed, turning away to leave.
_Tawnykit watched helplessly as her sister walked away into the darkness. She could at least stay there! But there was still no way to stop Shiverkit… She would keep annoying them… Keep attacking them… Keep getting them into trouble… She was faintly aware of Rustlekit and Whisperkit arguing about what to do, but a new idea emerged into her thoughts. If Shiverkit could get her into trouble… She could get Shiverkit into trouble! Tawnykit’s green eyes narrowed as she stared into the nursery. She would have her revenge.


/


_Tawnykit limped toward the nursery. Whisperkit and Rustlekit followed behind her. Hope seared in her heart. She had a plan, and it would work… But only if Ivykit agreed… Pausing for a moment, she stared doubtfully into the nursery. Would Ivykit really agree to do something so terrifying? Continuing forward, she decided that she just had to at least try to convince her.
_Inside the nursery, Ivykit slept.
_“Ivykit!” Rustlekit called. “Ivykit, wake up!”
_Ivykit blinked her forest green eyes sleepily.
_“What…?”
_“We have a plan.” Tawnykit announced. “Follow us.”
_The four kits headed to the gap between the apprentices’ den and the nursery, where they could talk without being overheard. Birds flapped noisily above their heads, black against the dawn light. Turing to Ivykit, Tawnykit told her the plan.
_“I can’t do that!” Ivykit’s eyes widened with fear.
_“But you have to!” Tawnykit wailed, her hope fading. “If you don’t, nothing will change. Shiverkit will taunt us and claw us forever.”
_“But-”
_The silver tabby shape of Shiverkit walked past, pausing near them to scent the air. Quickly, Tawnykit tugged Ivykit backwards by her scruff into a clump of grass by the camp barrier. Tawnykit’s heart pounded. Paws thudded softly against the ground as Shiverkit came closer, having picked up their scent.
_“Follow me!” Ivykit’s terrified voice whispered, brushing through the grass.
_“What are you doing?!” Tawnykit hissed, her eyes wide with fear. Ivykit was going out of the grass!
_“Just follow me!”
_Whisperkit moved in front of Tawnykit, following their sister. Tawnykit stepped into line behind him. From the edge of the grass, Tawnykit could see a small opening in the camp-wall, partly blocked by a muddy stone. Inside, she could see a flash of Whisperkit’s pale gray fur.
_But to get to the hole, Tawnykit would have to go through an unhidden gap, one which Shiverkit was slowly moving towards. Soon she would be able to see her, Tawnykit realized. Thinking quickly, she pushed a pebble across the ground towards the nursery. Shiverkit’s blue gaze darted to it for a moment, but that was all she needed.
_Tawnykit launched herself toward the hole, and scrambled inside. The place she entered was tight, with almost no room to move around in. It was dark, the only light a pale glow through a barrier of leaves. Maybe the leaves lead to another den? Tawnykit turned, eager to be out of the darkness, but a thorn caught on the cobweb on her shoulder, and she let out a squeak of pain as it poked into her shoulder wound.
_Tearing herself free, Tawnykit burst through the leaves into a moss filled den, its walls made of leaves. She was in the nursery. Whisperkit and Ivykit were already there. Wolfkit was curled up in the corner, still asleep.
_Suddenly, something pushed into her, knocking her over.
_“Sorry!” Rustlekit mewed as Tawnykit got to her paws.
_Tawnykit turned to walk toward Ivykit, whose pelt was bristling with fear. Ivykit looked at her, green eyes full of terror.
“I’ll help with the plan.”


/


_Tawnykit waited under the pine tree between the camp barrier and the medicine cat den. Whisperkit had suggested that they should meet there, where the older kits wouldn’t find them. The sunhigh sunlight cast dappled patterns from between the branches of the pine. Tawnykit’s shoulder still hurt from being poked by thorns and from when Rustlekit had accidently knocked her over.
_Uneven pawsteps sounded, and Tawnykit turned to see Rustlekit slip into the small space.
_“Is Ivykit okay?” Tawnykit shifted her orange paws uneasily. Would Ivykit really be brave enough to do this? Her own heart was pounding inside her chest, terrified of what they were about to do. She just wanted to go and curl up in her nest and forget all of this. She just wanted everything to be fixed.
_“She’s fine.” Rustlekit answered, breaking Tawnykit from her thoughts. “She’s in the clearing.”
_“Where’s Whisperkit?” Rustlekit looked around.
_“I don’t know.” Whisperkit was late, and Tawnykit was getting worried.
_Just then, a breathless mew sounded from behind them.
_“I’m here!” Whisperkit rushed into the clearing. His pale gray fur was now a dull matted brown, full of thorns and twigs. Tawnykit and Rustlekit began picking the leaves and thorns out of his muddy fur. Once he was clean, the three kits squeezed back out of the gap, Tawnykit in the lead.
_Outside, Shiverkit and her siblings stood watching Ivykit, who was slowly eating a mouse. Ivykit’s green gaze flickered to Tawnykit, and she began to eat faster. Tawnykit glanced at her siblings. Whisperkit’s fur bristled with terror, but his blue eyes glistened with excitement. Rustlekit’s tail was twitching with excitement. Tawnykit was terrified, but took steady steps forward.
_On the other side of the clearing, Glistenfern was eating a sparrow.
_“Gl-Glistenfern.” Tawnykit mewed nervously. “I lied about how I got hurt.”
_Glistenfern stared expectantly at her.
_“It was Shiverkit!” Tawnykit finally wailed. “Sh-She clawed me! And she said that she’d cl-claw me again if I told anyone she’d clawed m-me!”
_Glistenfern gave Tawnykit a comforting lick on her head.
_“I won’t let her claw you again.”
_Tawnykit turned to look at Shiverkit. She stared back, her blue eyes as cold as leaf-bare ice. She turned, and slunk away to the gap between the nursery and the apprentices’ den. Silverkit and Hazekit followed her into the dark shady place, their fur bristling slightly with fear and uncertainty.
_Tawnykit felt her own fur starting to bristle. Fear pulsed through her, her breath coming out in jagged bursts. Her plan was starting.














Shivers
_The mouse Ivykit was eating was bland and tasteless in her mouth. Her fur bristled with fear. Any moment now, Shiverkit was going to come and try to attack her.
_“Shiverkit’s going to attack me! Shiverkit’s going to attack me!” Ivykit repeated over and over in her mind, but still it didn’t seem real. Why would any cat agree to do this? What was wrong with her?
_Paws thudded against the ground. Ivykit looked up to see Shiverkit emerging from the darkness of the gap between the apprentices’ den and the nursery. Ivykit gulped down one last mouthful of mouse, before standing up. Terror pulsed through her, and her paws itched to run, but she forced herself to walk slowly and calmly toward the elders’ den.
_With a quick glance around the clearing to make sure that no one except for the older kits were watching her, she stepped away from the entrance, squeezing through a hole between the elders’ den and the warriors’ den. Whisperkit had worked hard, from dawn until sunhigh, to make that hole.
_The hole lead to a small, narrow tunnel. Hidden in the walls were two smaller spaces, where Whisperkit and Rustlekit were waiting, ready to grab Hazekit and Silverkit, stopping them from following their sister. Thorns scraped painfully against Ivykit’s pelt as she moved through it. Behind her, she heard Shiverkit follow, and started to move faster.
_Finally, Ivykit broke through into the fresh forest air. Green leaves shone brightly in the sunlight, the forest floor dappled with shadows. Ivykit hurried forward, a mellow breeze cooling her pelt. For a moment, she forgot that she was being chased by Shiverkit.
_But that moment didn’t last long. Claws lashed out as Ivykit’s tail, ripping out a tuft of black fur. Remembering the plan, Ivykit ran faster, heading toward a tall pine, covered with ivy. From when Whisperkit had gone out of the camp to look for sticks, he had seen that tree, with a bramble bush next to it. If Ivykit could turn fast enough, Shiverkit would run right into the brambles, and hopefully be stuck there.
_With a burst of speed, Ivykit moved faster, running right toward the bramble. But right before she hit it, she turned out of the way. Her hind paw scraped painfully against a stone embedded in the ground, but she didn’t care. Without looking back, she dashed over towards to hole. Terror drove her on. With a last heave of her aching legs, she burst through the hole.
_The tunnel was now a cave, bits of bramble pushed away to create more space. Silverkit and Hazekit stood together in the corner, Rustlekit guarding them, his forest green eyes gazing sternly at them. Silverkit let out terrified whimpers, while Hazekit pretended to be horrible and evil, like she normally did.
_“You can’t keep us here!” Hazekit hissed, lashing her claws through the air. But Rustlekit used a paw to hit her paw out of the air.
_Hazekit growled something to Silverkit, but didn’t try to attack again.
_“Ivykit!” Whisperkit purred, giving her a few licks to clean her ruffled fur. “Is Shiverkit stuck in the brambles?!”
_“I think she is.” Ivykit replied between gasps, her chest heaving. “She at least ran into them.”
_Ivykit let her paws collapse beneath her. Her legs hurt. Her paw throbbed from when she had stepped on that stone. The scent of blood hit her nose, and she realized that her paw must be bleeding.
_Whisperkit came over and gave his Ivykit a quick lick on the shoulder, before leaving. She closed her eyes, terror setting in. Shiverkit would surely kill her after this. A whimper of fear escaped through her jaws as she imagined claws piercing flesh… Her own blood splattering the ground… An unbearable pain ending in darkness…
_A horrible stinging pain sprouted from Ivykit’s paw, making her squeal and kick out at whatever was attacking it. But a tongue licked softly against her head, and Whisperkit’s scent emerged in the air. He had just been treating her paw. Again, the terrible pain came, but this time she didn’t move. She just gritted her teeth and tried to ignore it.
_When Whisperkit was finally done, Ivykit got to her paws, turning to look at Silverkit and Hazekit. Hazekit let out a long growling snarl, but her blue eyes were full of unhidden terror. Silverkit huddled against the wall of the small, cramped space, mewling to herself.
_“I’m the leader…” she murmured fearfully. “They can’t hurt me…”
_“We aren’t going to hurt you.” Ivykit mewed softly. The two older kits stared back at her, silvery gray fur on end. “We know what Shiverkit’s been doing. I think we should work together to get rid of her. She’s been terrorizing us all.”
_“H-How?” The fear seemed to fade out of Silverkit’s eyes to be replaced with curiosity.
_“I don’t know.” Ivykit replied doubtfully. “Tawnykit will think of something, and we’ll outnumber them.”
_But as hard as she tried, Ivykit couldn’t believe they could stop her. And even if they did, there was still Rosepaw and the other apprentices, and everyone in the clan hated them. There was no hope of being left alone.
_Suddenly, something pushed into her, sending Ivykit crashing into the ground. Hazekit’s fear scent washed over her in a wave of dread. Springing to her paws while turning around, Ivykit just saw tip of Hazekit’s puffed up pale gray tail as she disappeared into the camp. Ivykit started after her, but Silverkit stopped her with a wave of her tail.
_“She won’t tell on you.” Silverkit mewed. “She’ll be too scared to.”
_“Good.” Rustlekit replied, his brown tabby tail twitching anxiously.
_“So will you help us?” Whisperkit mewed pleadingly. Silverkit glanced outside towards where her sister went, before turning back to Whisperkit, looking torn.
_“I can’t.” she mewed. “That would mean betraying my sisters, and no matter how bad they are, that’s something that I just can’t do.”
_Silverkit turned away and stepped outside, back into the camp, leaving Ivykit and her littermates behind. They just stared at each other uncertainly, not knowing what to do.
_“What happened?” Tawnykit limped into the crowded tunnel-cave. “I saw Silverkit and Hazekit leave!”
_“Hazekit ran away because she was scared of us.” Whisperkit replied quietly, his blue eyes full of sadness. Was he that sad that Hazekit and Silverkit weren’t going to help him? It was bad…
_“Silverkit said she couldn’t go against her sisters,” Whisperkit continued. “And she left too.”
_“Well,” Tawnykit mewed disappointedly. “At least Shiverkit got stuck in the brambles.”
_For a moment, Tawnykit’s eyes widened in terror.
_“She did, didn’t she?!”
_“I-I don’t kn-know!” Ivykit took a step away from her sister. “I-I just r-ran away as f-fast as I c-could!”
_Calming down, Tawnykit gave her sister a quick lick on the shoulder.
_“If she weren’t stuck, she would have come back here to claw us.” Tawnykit mewed reassuringly, but Ivykit shuddered at the thought of claws ripping through flesh.
_A cold breeze swept through the tunnel-cave. Shivering, Ivykit pressed closer to her sister, feeling the warmth of her flank against her. Whisperkit and Rustlekit shuffled over beside them.
_Something flickered in the back of her mind. Curled up together in the cold… Warmth all around her… The soft, warm licking of a tongue against her back… The familiar scents of her littermates… But there was someone else… Another scent… 
_Ivykit blinked her eyes sleepily, before slowly letting them close. Who was that other cat… Was it- Was it her mother…? Her eyes closed, she was surrounded by darkness. But not complete darkness, she thought confusedly. Smooth muddy surfaces took shape around her. Was she asleep? No, she couldn’t be. Ivypaw could still feel the coldness and hear the rush of the air around her. But some thought, some idea in the back of her mind told her she didn’t. It wasn’t the wind she heard. It was something else…




_The wind of the dark cave… The cave was her home… It was RougeClan, clan of darkness… And of where comes the darkness…? Whispering voices overlapped, trying to answer… Fading away… But Ivykit knew now.
_She was the darkness.
_The whispering got louder. It wasn’t whispers. It was yowls… Fearful yowling voices that echoed around the cave… The cave of RougeClan. The cave of darkness. A voice cut loudly through the chaotic air, crying out her name in terror.
_“Ivykit!”
_Whisperkit stood over her, his blue eyes a mixture of fear and excitement.
_“Shiverkit’s back!”


















Half a Truth
_Rustlekit’s paws thumped against the dusty ground as he burst out of the tunnel-cave. Cats were gathered in the clearing, their fur on end. Slipping silently between the cats’ paws, Rustlekit joined Tawnykit at the front of the crowd. In front of them stood Otterheart, her apprentice Mewpaw, Woodstep, and Sparrowflight. And, standing at their paws, was Shiverkit.
_Shiverkit’s silver pelt was now a dull, half matted gray. Clumps of muddy fur were torn out, and blood oozed slowly out of a few bad scratches. But the worst part, the very most horrible part was the glare she gave him. Blue eyes glared directly at him, full of rage and fury. Rustlekit took a step back, half afraid she’d leap at him and tear his throat out.
_“Shiverkit!” Shimmerstone hurtled through the gathered cats and crouched next to her kit. Shiverkit pressed close to her mother, her matted fur bristling with fake fear.
_“What happened?” Shimmerstone asked Woodstep, who had been leading the patrol.
_“We heard her calling for help on our way back.” the light brown tom answered. “We found her tangled in a thorn bush.”
_“Poor kit.” Otterheart sighed. “She was so scared.”
_Rustlekit felt a burst of anger. What was wrong with these cats?! Weren’t they at least a little bit suspicious of why Shiverkit was out there?! And why couldn’t Shimmerstone ask Shiverkit what happened?! Why didn’t these mouse-brained warriors think that they were so smart and important and that kits didn’t understand anything?! Tawnykit turned her forest green gaze to stare at him, and Rustlekit realized that he was growling. Holding back his fury, he watched to see what would happen next.
_“Shiverkit, what were you thinking wandering out of camp on your own?!” Shimmerstone cried. Shiverkit opened her mouth to answer, but Shimmerstone cut her off. “I know,” she mewed “You must have thought exploring the outside would be fun. But it’s too dangerous for kits.”
_Rustlekit’s green eyes blazed with anger. She wasn’t even letting Shiverkit speak! Rustlekit opened his mouth to snarl at them, but closed it again. Shiverkit deserved this! No, she deserved worse than this!
_“What’s going on?” Whisperkit sat down beside his brother, Ivykit following close behind.
_“They found Shiverkit.” Rustlekit whispered back. “They think she just wanted to explore.”
_Rustlekit turned his attention away from his brother as Sorrelstar climbed swiftly up onto the High-Branch, her green eyes staring down disapprovingly at Shiverkit.
_“It was a bad decision to leave camp,” Sorrelstar mewed to the kit. “But you must understand that now, since you got stuck in the brambles. If you go out of the camp again, I’ll have to postpone your apprentice ceremony. Do you want that?”
_“No.” Shiverkit choked the word out, looking like she wanted to rip off Sorrelstar’s pelt. _“But this is unfair! I didn’t-”
_Sorrelstar gave a single lash of her tortoiseshell tail, along with a stern glare down at the silver-furred she-kit, silencing her. Then, she turned her gaze to look at all the kits. Rustlekit stood firmly on the ground as Sorrelstar’s green graze passed over him. He had done nothing wrong.
_“No kit must must leave the camp until they are six moons old.” Sorrelstar continued, giving Tawnykit an extra glance. “That is part of the warrior code. Do you all understand that?”
_“Yes.” Rustlekit answered, his green gaze meeting Sorrelstar’s eyes, before falling nervously back down to the ground.
_Infront of the nursery, Wolfkit nodded his head nervously.
_“Yes.” his littermates echoed, and he thought he heard a fourth voice, Silverkit, but it was quiet and scared. Over on the other side of the clearing, Hazekit could only nod her head.
_Sorrelstar turned her gaze to rest expectantly on Shiverkit. After what felt like a season, Shiverkit glared up at her and spat “Fine!”, before turning away. Rustlekit wasn’t sure, but he thought he saw Sorrelstar flinch. He could understand that. Shiverkit was terrifying.
_Whispers flooded the clearing as the cats turned to leave. Cloudfur, Silverkit, and Hazekit, joined Shimmerstone and Shiverkit as they went back to the nursery.
_“Wait!” A voice rose up above the clan’s mewing. Thirty-five pairs of eyes turned to look at Tawnykit.
_“S-Sorrel-st-st-star?” Tawnykit trembled, pressing closely against Rustlekit.
_“Yes?” Sorrelstar’s voice was soothing.
_“I-I lied about how I g-got h-hurt.” Tawnykit mewled. “I-I wasn’t tr-trying to escape c-camp.”
_“What happened?” Sorrelstar asked, her head tilted questionly.
_Tawnykit pressed closer to Rustlekit, giving Shiverkit a terrified glance. Across the clearing, Shiverkit snarled back, and Tawnykit flinched. Rustlekit knew Tawnykit was as scared as she acted, but she definitely was scared. How could a cat not be scared under the terrifying gaze of Shiverkit?
_Tawnykit stared up at the ForestClan leader, her forest green eyes wide with fear.
_“It was Shiverkit.”
_At once, voices rose up from the gathered cats.
_“How’s that possible?!” a cat cried.
_“Shiverkit would never do anything like that!” Rustlekit thought that was Shimmerstone.
_“That rogue-kit is wrong!” Sparrowflight spat.
_“Who are we to trust a rogue over a ForestClan-born kit?!” Stalkingleaf added in a snarl. Rustlekit wanted to shred her. Anger boiled in his heart. It was so unfair.
_“But how are clanless-born kits any different than clan-born kits?” A voice mewed, and the whole clearing dropped into silence. Turning around, Rustlekit wandered through the crowd, trying to get a view of the cat who’d spoken up. A golden-brown she-cat stood in the center of the clearing, her green eyes glaring angrily at Stalkingleaf. Glistenfern! Flanking her was Duskstorm, his dark blue eyes daring the gray-brown tabby she-cat to challenge them. Rustlekit let out a purr.
_“It isn’t where a cat is born that makes them trustworthy or untrustworthy.” Glistenfern continued. “It’s where they grow up.”
_“That makes no sense at all!” A cat yowled, and the whole clearing became full of angry cats yowling their confusion.
_“Are you comparing us to rogues?!” Foxfur screeched.
_“We are not rogues!” Needlefur yowled. “How dare you call us rogues!”
_The cats continued hurling furious comments at the two cats. Rustlekit and his littermates huddled close together. Right now, they were only saying mean things to Duskstorm and Glistenfern. But if this didn’t stop, would they attack them? Rustlekit shivered, moving closer to Ivykit.
_“I don’t think she was trying to say that we were rogues!” Snowyshine tried to meow from next to Whisperkit, but her voice was drowned out by the rest of the cats.
_Rustlekit’s ears burned. His head ached. When was this going to stop?!
“Silence!” Sorrelstar yowl. At once, the cats become quiet, staring up at their leader.
“Tawnykit,” Sorrelstar mewed. Next to Rustlekit, Tawnykit stared up at the leader of ForestClan, her orangish fur bristling fearfully. “What exactly did Shiverkit do?”
“I-I was by the a-apprentices’ den, l-listening to w-what th-they were s-saying about the p-patrols th-they went on that d-day.” Tawnykit mewled, her green eyes a forest of terror. “Th-They told me t-to g-go away, and wh-while I w-was l-leaving, I-I r-ran into Sh-Sh-Shiver-k-kit.”
_Tawnykit paused to look fearfully at Shiverkit, edging closer to Rustlekit and their other littermates.
_“What happened next?” Sorrelstar asked softly. Tawnykit trembled, letting out whimpers of terror that Rustlekit almost thought were real.
_“She scr-scratched my shoulder!” Tawnykit finally choked out. “And gr-grabbed me! B-By my scruff!”
_Rustlekit gave his sister a few comforting licks. Tawnykit looked around the clearing, shivering. She pressed herself to the ground in a way that made it look as if she just wanted to sink into a clump of grass and disappear forever. She was really good at pretending to be scared! Maybe not completely pretending…
_“Sh-She dragged m-me.” Tawnykit continued in a petrified voice. “In-Into th-that g-g-gap between the appren-apprentice’s d-den and the nur-nursery. She put her paw on my n-neck!”
_Whispers broke into the clearing, and cats shot each other disbelieving looks.
_“Quiet!” Sorrelstar yowled, silencing the clan. “What did she do next?” Sorrelstar asked quietly. The softness in her green eyes seemed to calm Tawnykit down a bit, though she still quivered a little as she spoke.
_“She- She c-called me a mang- a mangy r-rouge!” Tawnykit wailed. “I was sc-scared. I tr-tried to c-call for he-help, but she cov-covered my m-mouth with her p-paw!”
_“She- I- I tr-tried to escape!” Tawnykit shuddered, her green eyes wide with terror. “But she- But she…”
_Rustlekit and Whisperkit licked her fur ruffled fluffy fur until it was smooth. Ivykit just stared fearfully at her paws.
_“She cl-clawed my b-b-belly!” Tawnykit screeched. She burrowed her head into Rustlekit’s flank, shaking with terror. A few moments later, Tawnykit stood up tall, looking like she was summoning all her courage to tell the rest of her story of what had happened.
_“She said horrible things about me!” Tawnykit spoke quickly and fearfully. “She threatened to claw me again! I bit her paw that was over my mouth and ran! But she grabbed my tail! I knew I couldn’t escape. I yowled for help, but she knocked me over. My paw got hurt! She dragged me and tangled me up in the brambles in the camp barrier. I heard pawsteps coming. Someone was coming to save me! Narrowstream came! Shiverkit said that I was trying to escape camp. I was about to say what actually happened, but…”
_Tawnykit shuddered, and this time, Rustlekit could see that she was actually afraid.
_“She pointed her tail toward Ivykit, who was eating a thrush. And she- she clawed the ground. If I said what happened, she’d- she’d- she’d hurt my sister! So I lied.”
_Tawnykit sunk to the ground, not wanting to meet any cats’ eye. Ivykit shuddered, and Rustlekit gave her a quick lick. Whatever happened, it was all up to Sorrelstar.
_Balanced on the High-Branch, Sorrelstar tilted her head, deep in thought. Then, she turned her foresty gaze to Shiverkit. Rustlekit’s heart pounded. Was she going to punish her?
_“Shiverkit,” Sorrelstar mewed. “What’s your version of what happened?”


























































Shiverkit’s Truth
_Shiverkit stared around the clearing, her blue eyes as wide as the sky. Tawnykit’s heart pounded with the tension, and she forced herself to half-fakely tremble. After what felt like a season, Shiverkit opened her mouth to mew.
_“It wasn’t me!” Shiverkit cried, backing up to cower against her mother. Shimmerstone gave her kit a few licks on the head before looking up to glare accusingly at Tawnykit. The cats’ gazes burned her pelt, and Tawnykit crept slowly backward, nervously shrinking away.
_Her tail brushed against something fluffy, and Tawnykit let out a startled meow of fear. Turning around with a leap backward, she turned to see a golden tinged cat with caring green eyes. Glistenfern! Tawnykit moved farther away from Shiverkit, peering out from behind Glistenfern. Next to her, the brown-furred she-cat glared furiously at Shimmerstone and her kit. 
_Shimmerstone glared back, her purple-blue eyes full of rage. Shiverkit let out a fake mewl of fear, and her mother bent down to give her a comforting lick. Cloudfur stood next to them, Silverkit and Hazekit pressing close beside him. Hazekit stood next to her father, her gray fur on end. Though she tried to look defiant, her legs trembled and she seemed to be letting out faint whimpers of fear. Hazekit was clearly terrified and confused. Tawnykit turned to look at Silverkit and was shocked by what she saw.
_Silverkit sat calmly next to her sister. Her silver tail twitched curiously, her purple-blue eyes unafraid. As Shiverkit let out another fake whimper, a glimmer of anger shone in her gaze. She seemed to hate her sister, even though she couldn’t go against her. But Tawnykit guessed Silverkit also didn’t want to abandon Hazekit to be terrorized by their mangy deceiving fox-heart of a sister. Tawnykit could understand that. Hazekit shivered and pressed closer into Cloudfur’s sleek pelt, before standing up again and glaring around the clearing. Next to her sister, Silverkit seemed giant. If Tawnykit hadn’t known she was a kit, she’d have thought she was an apprentice! Right now she was acting like one too…
_“How dare you accuse Shiverkit of something like this?!” Shimmerstone spat furiously at Tawnykit. “You don’t even have any evidence!”
_At once, the gathered cats started yowling at Tawnykit.
_“Rouge!”
_“Liar!”
_Tawnykit buried her face into Glistenfern’s fur, hoping her fluffy pelt would block out the noise. She felt completely miserable. Every cat hated her even more now. And Shiverkit would always get her way, Tawnykit thought in disgust. Because she was clan-born.
_A soft tongue stroked her back.
_“Don’t listen to them.” Glistenfern whispered soothingly. “They’re wrong.”
_Tawnykit let out a soft, trembling purr. At least some cats cared about her.
_“It’s true Tawnykit doesn’t have any evidence!” Duskstorm yowled above the snarling of the rest of the clan, alerting Tawnykit back to what was happening in the clearing around her. “But Shiverkit doesn’t either!”
_The whole clearing went silent. Not even a bird chirped. For a moment, Tawnykit thought she was deaf, but she realized that she could hear a low rumbling sound. Looking around the clearing, she realized that the rumbling was coming from Shimmerstone’s throat.
_“Are you calling my kit a liar?” Shimmerstone growled. The surrounding cats started to back away nervously, leaving a clear path between the angry cat and Duskstorm. Cloudfur stayed closer to Shimmerstone, his kits huddling at his side. Silverkit no longer looked calm. Now, her purple-blue eyes were wide with terror. Duskstorm faced Shimmerstone, glaring evenly back at her. His dark gray tipped fur was on end.
_Then Duskstorm let his fur lie flat, his dark blue gaze full of sympathy.
_“I’m sorry.” he mewed. “Your kit is a liar.”
_Silver fur flashed across the clearing, a yowl of pure hatred filling the air. Tawnykit bristled with shock as Shimmerstone flung herself at the dark brown tom, her unsheathed claws lashing out to tear a deep scar into Duskstorm’s flank. Duskstorm let out a surprised yowl of pain, flinging himself backwards and falling onto the ground. Shimmerstone raked her claws through his pelt, sinking her teeth into his front leg. Duskstorm’s yowl of pain hit the air, followed by the horrifying scent of blood.
_Glistenfern leaped to her paws and raced across the clearing, grabbing Shimmerstone’s hind leg in her jaws. She tugged Shimmerstone backward, and Shimmerstone turned around to aim a blow at her face. Duskstorm got to his paws and shoved her over onto the ground. Together, they tried to pin down the furious she-cat, but Shimmerstone kept struggling, lashing out at them in her rage.
_Tawnykit stared up at Sorrelstar. Why wouldn’t she do something?! Sorrelstar stared at the fighting cats, a shocked look in her green eyes. Her claws were dug deep into the bark of the High-Branch as if she was stuck there.
_Turning her head, Tawnykit turned to look at Shiverkit. What did she think of the trouble she’d caused?! Shiverkit’s blue eyes were as wide as the sky, full of fake terror. Her silver tabby fur was bristling with fear, as she huddled next to her sisters. Tawnykit’s orange fur bristled in outrage. How dare she pretend to be scared! This was all her fault!
_Next to Shiverkit, Hazekit pressed close to their father, trembling. Silverkit also looked terrified. Those kits must care about their mother a lot. Tawnykit felt a glimmer of emptiness in her heart. She would never know what that felt like. Tawnykit shook her head to clear it. She would never know who her parents were. There was no point in feeling sorry for herself. Anger hardened inside her. Why would she want parents who abandoned her?! Tawnykit looked at her littermates who trembled beside her, before looking at Narrowstream and Dreamheart, and finally settling her gaze on Glistenfern and Duskstorm, fighting to save them from Shiverkit’s lies. Tawnykit stood up tall, determination and strength filling her bright green eyes. She didn’t need her parents. She had her own family here.
_Cloudfur took a step toward the fighting cats, but turned back to his kits, looking torn. Making a decision, Cloudfur launched himself toward Glistenfern, ready to sink his teeth into her fluffy golden tail.
_A flash of tortoiseshell fur sprang down from the High-Branch, knocking Cloudfur over. Glistenfern turned her head to look around, and Shimmerstone used her distraction to push Duskstorm off his paws. Hearing Duskstorm’s screech of pain, Glistenfern turned around, ready to pull Shimmerstone off of Duskstorm. But Sorrelstar ran between the two cats and, grabbing Shimmerstone by her scruff, pulled her away. Shimmerstone still thrashed, slashing her claws across Sorrelstar’s face. But her movements were now just angry blows, hoping to rip fur and flesh. Sorrelstar easily pinned the angered she-cat down.
_“Shimmerstone,” Sorrelstar mewed softly. “Calm down.”
_Shimmerstone stopped struggling, and Sorrelstar let her get back up.
_“No one will blame your kit if she is innocent.” Sorrelstar told her.
_Shimmerstone crouched down, lowering her head in respect and acceptance. Then, she turned around to walk back to her mate and kits, with a shameful glance at the scar she’d left on Sorrelstar’s face.
_Sorrelstar climbed back up onto the High-Branch.
_“Shimmerstone, Gistenfern, Duskstorm!” Sorrelstar called. “Go with Dreamheart to the medicine cat den to have your wounds healed.”
_Whisperkit started to walk towards Dreamheart to help, but then glanced back at his littermates, not knowing what to do. Dreamheart turned around giving him a look with her purple-blue eyes and flicking her tail against the ground, telling Whisperkit to stay. Rustlekit stared anxiously after Glistenfern and Duskstorm as they disappeared into the medicine cat den.
_“ForestClan!” Sorrelstar meowed, turning back to the rest of the clan. “There will be no more fighting today. Shiverkit, tell us what happened.”
_“Me, Silverkit, and Hazekit were playing outside the nursery.” Shiverkit began. “And then Tawnykit came and attacked Hazekit!” Shiverkit let out a wail of fake fear making Tawnykit’s fur bristle with rage.
_“And then Silverkit and Hazekit dragged Tawnykit into the gap between the nursery and the apprentices’ den.” Shiverkit continued her story, shaking with fear. “They clawed her and called her bad stuff. But she deserved it! She’d attacked us! But still I- I tried to tell them to stop because I d-didn’t want to g-get into tr-trouble, but they didn’t listen to me!” Shiverkit broke off in another wail.
_“And they started arguing. And then Tawnykit bit Silverkit! And- and she tr-tried to claw us! But Silverkit and Hazekit caught her, and she tried to call for help. She was trying to pretend that we’d attacked her! She wanted to get us in trouble! But by the time Narrowstream came, they tangled her up in the camp barrier.”
_“Now,” Sorrelstar meowed before any of the cats could start to argue. “Does anyone here have any evidence of where each kit was and what happened?”
_Tawnykit stared at her littermates, her green eyes a forest of misery. There was no way she was going to win. Shiverkit’s story would have more evidence because she had told the truth. Not the truth, Tawnykit thought in anger, but her twisted truth. But no matter what, Shiverkit was going to win. Silverkit would be blamed. And Tawnykit would be doomed.










Blame
_All was silent. No cat spoke. Whisperkit could feel the tension in the air. Darkshadow looked questioningly at Blackclaw, but his brother just shook his head to say he had no idea what had happened. From in front of the apprentices’ den, Mewpaw flicked her tail at her sister, telling her to say what happened in front of the apprentices’ den. Mistypaw gave her a fearful glare, her blueish fur fluffing up slightly, before settling down.
_Sorrelstar’s white tipped tail twitched curiously, her green gaze scanning over the nervous cats. Narrowstream’s mother, Stalkingleaf, hissed something into her ear, but the two cats froze under Sorrelstar’s gaze. Whisperkit felt a little relieved. If no cat said anything, the accusations might just be ignored, since there was no evidence. He just wanted this to be over. What was Tawnykit thinking?! How did she think she could just say Shiverkit attacked her when that wasn’t the exact truth and no cat would believe her?! Why couldn’t she just-
_“Apprentices,” Sorrelstar’s voice interrupted Whisperkit’s thoughts. “Do you know what happened?”
_Rosepaw stood calmly beside her brother, Thornpaw, though her twitching tail betrayed her nervousness. Herringpaw stood just behind her, his darkish blue eyes as wide as an ocean under Sorrelstar’s questioning gaze.
_Mistypaw and Mewpaw stood nearby, giving each other nervous looks. Mistypaw gave another look at Mewpaw, telling her to speak. The gray-brown she-cat shrunk away towards the apprentice den, shaking her head. Mistypaw looked pleadingly at the other apprentices. Rosepaw shook her head and opened her mouth in a silent snarl. Thornpaw copied her, his gray fur bristling slightly. Herringpaw looked torn between his sisters and his friends, but in the end, he just stayed quiet, giving his sister a glare so Thornpaw wouldn’t get angry at him.
_Mistypaw stood still trying to calm herself. Finally, she spoke.
_“Tawnykit was arguing with Rosepaw, Thornpaw, and Herringpaw.” Mistypaw spat her brother’s name out, her amber eyes full of rage at his betrayal. “Thornpaw got really angry at her, and tried to attack her, but she ran away. I’m not sure, but I thought I saw her run into one of the other kits while she was running away. I think it was Hazekit,” Mistypaw gave a guilty look at Tawnykit. “But I’m not sure. It could have been Shiverkit. I don’t know what happened to Tawnykit after that.”
_“Thank you, Mistypaw.” Sorrelstar mewed.
_Mistypaw dipped her head in respect to her leader, before moving back to where Mewpaw was sitting.
_“Do any of you have any other information.” Sorrelstar looked to the other apprentices. They shook their heads. “Thornpaw,” Sorrelstar turned to the gray-furred tom. “Is it true that you tried to attack Tawnykit?”
_“No!” Thornpaw wailed, his green eyes wide with fear. “Why would I attack a kit?!”
_“I saw him try to attack her!” Mewpaw yowled.
_“I did not!” Thornpaw protested. He grumbled something quietly to his sister, and Rosepaw nodded her head in agreement.
_“My brother wouldn’t hurt the rogue-kits no matter how horrible they were being!” Rosepaw spat, turning to glare at Sorrelstar. The tortoiseshell she-cat looked shocked that an apprentice would say something like that.
_“Apprentices!” Whisperkit heard Eaglewing mutter. “When I was a warrior, Thrushstar would never let those mouse-brains talk back to her like this!”
_“Yes.” Treebranch, Eaglewing’s mate agreed sadly. “My sister was a good leader.”
_Turning his attention back to what was going on in the clearing, Whisperkit saw that the apprentices had divided themselves into two groups. Mistypaw bristled beside Mewpaw, Foxfur,  their father and Mistypaw’s mentor, glaring at Rosepaw and Thornpaw from behind them. Rosepaw and Thornpaw were perched on the branch that came out of the apprentices’ den. Just beneath them stood their parents, Stalkingleaf and Twigtail, who gave accusing glares at the other apprentices. From nearby Whisperkit, Narrowstream made to move toward them, but turned back muttering:
_“Those mouse-brains don’t deserve my support, even if they’re my family.”
_Whisperkit remembered in surprise that Narrowstream was Rosepaw and Thornpaw’s older sister. He thought that was odd. Narrowstream was nothing like her rude and thoughtless family.
_“My kits wouldn’t lie!” Foxfur looked pleadingly at Sorrelstar. The ForestClan leader gave him a torn look to tell her son that she believed him, but she had to be fair. Turing her gaze away from Foxfur, she looked at the apprentices, her gaze settling on Herringpaw. Whisperkit realized the orange-furred tom was the only apprentice who hadn’t spoken. Herringpaw was still standing in the middle of the two groups of angry cats, his blue eyes wide with panic and indecision. Whisperkit felt sorry for him, not knowing whether to side with his family or friends. Whisperkit tipped his head in confusion. Who would want to be friends with Rosepaw and Thornpaw?! All they ever did was order everyone around!
_Sorrelstar had seemed to have come to the same conclusion that Whisperkit had, and stayed quiet, not wanting to force Herringpaw to make a decision. But other cats had realized that Herringpaw hadn’t spoken too, including Rosepaw.
_“Thornpaw would never attack a kit, would he Herringpaw?!” The light brown tabby she-cat mewed. Herringpaw’s fluffy pelt stood on end. He gave a quick glance at his family, and looked away at the sight of his sister’s glares, his blue eyes full of guilt and hurt. Then, he was facing Rosepaw who looked at him expectantly. Whisperkit was surprised to find that she wasn’t snarling at Herringpaw in a demanding way. It was Thornpaw who snarled at him, a tinge of fear in his green eyes. Though they were bullies, Rosepaw and Thornpaw still felt fear. Unlike Shiverkit. Whisperkit shuddered as he caught sight of her icy blue eyes glaring angrily at him, and quickly looked away.
_“N-No…” Herringpaw shrunk beneath the gazes of the clan. “Th-Thornpaw would n-never d-do that.”
_“But you saw him leap at her with your own eyes!” Mewpaw spat. Herringpaw moved closer to Rosepaw, who gave him a lick on the shoulder to comfort him. Mistypaw let out a snarl, her amber eyes unforgiving.
_“I didn’t see anything!” Herringpaw wailed. “I wasn’t watching!”
_“There is not way you weren’t watching!” Mistypaw screeched, making Herringpaw flinch. “You’re a liar and you know it!”
_“Tell the truth, Herringpaw!” Mewpaw urged him. “Those fox-hearts aren’t your friends!”
_Herringpaw started to shake with panic. Whisperkit could tell that this wasn’t about the truth anymore.
_“Why do you have to make me choose!” Herringpaw yowled. “I can’t choose between you and my friends!”
_Mistypaw opened her mouth to snarl at her brother, but the orange tom wasn’t finished.
_“Why do you have to hate each other?!” Herringpaw spat. “Rosepaw, Thornpaw, why can’t you just stop bossing them around?! And why can’t you,” Herringpaw flicked his fluffy tail toward his sister. “Stop acting like my friends are cruel fox-hearts that act like rogues?!” 
_Whisperkit flinched at that comment. But he and his littermates weren’t rogues, he reminded himself. They were clan cats like the rest of ForestClan.
_The apprentices were silent with shock. Mistypaw looked like she wanted to tear her brother’s throat out, while Mewpaw just stared at Herringpaw. Thornpaw’s shocked expression twisted into a snarl. Whisperkit turned to look at Rosepaw. The light brown tabby she-cat stood still, stunned by what her friend had said. Her forest green eyes were full of guilt and shame. But Rosepaw dug her claws into the ground, her eyes lighting up with anger.
_“Those mangy weaklings need bossing around!” Rosepaw spat. She turned around and fled into the apprentices den. Whisperkit was shocked. Why had she gotten so angry?!
_Herringpaw started to move towards Thornpaw, but he let out a hiss and turned away. Herringpaw turned back toward his sisters, but started to back away from Mistypaw’s killing glare. Foxfur let out a disappointed sigh, and went to stand beside his son.
_“Please stop being angry with each other!” Foxfur pleaded. Mewpaw let out a snort. “Ashflower wouldn’t want this!”
_The two grayish-furred she-cats reluctantly went to stand on Foxfur’s other side, looking sad at the memory of their mother. Whisperkit had heard that Ashflower had died of greencough when they were only kits.
_“Two cats say that Thornpaw attacked Tawnykit, and two cats say he didn’t.” Sorrelstar mewed. “Are there any other cats who know what happened?”
_“Sorrelstar?!” A voice mewed from beside Whisperkit. Sorrelstar looked down at Tawnykit. “H-He did tr-try to a-a-attack m-me!”
_Sorrelstar looked at the tawny-furred she-kit, her green gaze full of embarrassment and guilt that she forgot that Tawnykit would know whether she was attacked or not.
_“Thornpaw,” Sorrelstar turned to look at the gray-furred tom, a glint of anger in her eyes. “Warriors do not attack kits.” Thornpaw stared up at his leader, his green eyes full of anxious terror. “You will remove the elders’ ticks and replace their moss for the next half a moon. For the next two days you will not leave camp. It would have been longer, but I don’t want you to get behind on your training.” Sorrelstar nodded to Heathershine, Thornpaw’s mentor. Sorrelstar flicked her black tail toward the elders’ den, her forest green eyes stern. “I hope the elders remind you of the warrior code,” Sorrelstar meowed after Thornpaw as he slunk away to replace the elders’ bedding. “Because you seem to have forgotten it!”
_“Does anyone else know what happened with Tawnykit and Shiverkit?” Sorrelstar turned to the rest of her clan.
_“I thought I saw the older kits go towards the apprentices’ den.” Blackclaw answered, and Wolfkit nodded his head nervously. “I saw Silverkit leading them, while Shiverkit lagged behind. Now that I think about it, she looked a little scared.”
_“Anything else?” The clan stayed silent.
_“Tawnykit,” Sorrelstar mewed. Whisperkit felt his sister press against him, though he could tell she wasn’t actually that scared. “Are you sure it was Shiverkit you ran into?”
_“It m-might have been H-Hazekit.” Tawnykit confessed, knowing that agreeing with Shiverkit was the best way out of the situation. “I c-couldn’t tell who I r-ran into, I just assumed it was Sh-Shiverkit because I thought she a-attacked me!”
_“And are you completely sure it was Shiverkit who attacked you?” Sorrelstar questioned, her green eyes soft and gentle.
_“I-I only s-saw s-silver fur.” Tawnykit answered. “I th-thought I sm-smelled Sh-Shiverkit, and I th-thought it w-was Sh-Shiverkit because she m-meaner than S-Silverkit. It c-could have been S-Silverkit.”
_“Silverkit, Hazekit.” Sorrelstar turned to the two kits who huddled beside their mother. Their blueish eyes were opened wide with terror. Cloudfur gave his kits comforting licks before stepping forward.
_“You have evidence that my kits were there,” Cloudfur mewed, trying to stay calm though his fur was bristling. “But you have no evidence that she actually hurt her!”
_“Cloudfur,” Sorrelstar mewed gently. “Shiverkit said herself that her sisters hurt Tawnykit. I’m sorry, but that’s evidence.”
_“Silverkit, Hazekit,” Sorrelstar continued, a stern anger in her eyes. “You are confined to the nursery for one moon. Your apprenticeship will also be delayed by one moon. We do not attack our clanmates!”
_Hazekit nodded her head and slipped away into the nursery. Silverkit followed, but paused, about to say something. Shiverkit glared at her sister, and Silverkit quickly hurried away. 
_The other cats in the clearing slipped away into their dens as a faint yellow glow appeared at the edge of the sky, marking the start of the sunset. Whisperkit felt horrible. He turned to look at Shiverkit, who glanced back at him with her cruel blue eyes. Whisperkit shuddered. Silverkit and Hazekit were getting blamed. And Shiverkit was free to do whatever fox-hearted stuff she wanted.


















A Battle Last Green-Leaf
_Rustlekit limp-walked towards the medicine cat den. How was Duskstorm? Rustlekit shuddered at the memory of him limping away, his dark brown fur turned crimson with blood.
_“Duskstorm?” Rustlekit called softly, entering the cave. Dreamheart was smearing a poultice on a scratch on Glistenfern’s leg, while Whisperkit grabbed a cobweb from the den wall. Next to Glistenfern, Duskstorm lay in a pile of moss, his flank plastered with cobwebs. Shimmerstone crouched in the corner of the cave, looking guilty at the wounds she’d inflicted.
_“Hi, Rustlekit.” Whisperkit mewed to his brother, his blue eyes dull.
_“Is Duskstorm okay?” Rustlekit could see that Glistenfern was fine, nervously licking the drying blood from Duskstorm’s fur.
_“I’m fine.” Duskstorm mewed from where he lay. “My wounds just hurt a bit. I’ve had worse in battles.”
_“You’ve been in battles?!” Rustlekit mewed, his forest green eyes shining with curiosity.
_“Many battles.” Duskstorm answered. “I remember last green-leaf, when I was still an apprentice, BirchClan attacked a hunting patrol that was hunting in the Part-Birch Forest in their old territory. Honeystar was so angry that we took the Part-Birch Forest territory down to the Lower-River from them last New-Leaf, that they tried to steal our territory up to the Tallest-Pine!”
_“The Tallest-Pine!” Rustlekit exclaimed. “Isn’t that really close to camp?!”
_“No,” Duskstorm replied, his dark blue eyes gleaming with excitement at teaching the young tom-kit. “It’s about halfway from the camp to the current border. But the edge of the Half-Birch Forest is really close to our camp.” Duskstorm shuddered, then winced at the pain his movement had caused. “It would be really bad if they took the territory up to there.”
_“How close is it?” Rustlekit asked nervously.
_“Listen.” Duskstorm instructed. Rustlekit tilted his head to listen. He could hear the warriors talking, and the elders muttering to each other. But Rustlekit listened beyond the camp, trying to hear out into the forest. Almost hidden by the chattering of the birds and the rush of the wind, Rustlekit could hear a faint roar.
_“What is it?” Rustlekit asked, turning back to Duskstorm.
_“That’s Wide-River.” The dark brown tom replied. “It splits into two separate rivers around Riversplit-Rock about thirty fox-lengths away, Long-River and Lower-River. Lower-River is that way,” Duskstorm carefully flicked his tail in the direction of the Apprentices’ den, in the opposite of the camp entrance. “And Long-River goes that direction,” Duskstorm flicked his tail in the direction of the den entrance. “And goes on before a bit further about a hundred fox-lengths before turning downhill back that way.” Duskstorm flicked his tail back towards the apprentices’ den. “It’s called Long-River because it goes all the way through the center of BirchClan’s territory, through VioletClan’s territory, and breaks up into smaller streams near the twolegplace.”
_Rustlekit’s eyes opened wide with amazement. Long-River went more than a hundred fox-lengths through ForestClan territory! And it still didn’t go all the way across ForestClan territory! And there were four clan territories! And there was the Twolegplace, the Foxlands, and the Unknown-Land! The world really was huge.
_“So where is the Part-Birch Forest?” Rustlekit asked again, when he realized that Duskstorm hadn’t answered his question yet.
_“It’s between the Long-River and the Lower-River.” Duskstorm answered.
_“Do you mean it goes all the way up to the Riversplit-Rock, where the Wide-River splits?!” Rustlekit exclaimed. Duskstorm nodded. “But if they took that territory, they’d be so close to camp!”
_“That’s why, even though we didn’t need the territory for prey, we had to win against BirchClan.” Duskstorm mewed. “If they took the Part-Birch Forest up to the Tallest-Pine, they’d feel confident enough to try to take the rest of the Part-Birch Forest, and we couldn’t risk that.”
_Rustlekit nodded in understanding.
_“Also,” Duskstorm said with a snort. “There are some cats here who’d fling themselves off a cliff if they were challenged to.”
_Rustlekit looked around the clearing. Stalkingleaf was sitting by her sister, Needlefur, while Sparrowflight talked to his sons, Blackclaw and Darkshadow. Some cats were mouse-brained enough to do that.
_“So what happened in the battle?” Rustlekit asked curiously. No one had ever told him what had happened in any battle before.
_“It started when Shimmerstone, Cloudfur, Twigtail, and Honeypaw came back from a hunting patrol.” Duskstorm began. “Shimmerstone was limping, and Twigtail had a deep scratch on his flank. They told us that BirchClan had attacked them, claiming that the Half-Birch Forest territory up to the Tallest-Pine was theirs.”
_“What did you do?!” Rustlekit asked excitedly.
_“Sorrelstar decided that we’d ignore what BirchClan had said, and treat the territory Honeystar was trying to take as ours while patrolling it more so BirchClan knew we wouldn’t give up without a fight.”
_“Then,” Duskstorm continued. “Glistenfern- she was Glistenpaw back then, Glistenpaw came back from a border patrol. She and her patrol had found BirchClan warriors hunting in our territory.”
_“I clawed them until they ran away bleeding!” Glistenfern purred. Duskstorm gave her an affectionate lick on the ear before turning back to Rustlekit.
_“We encountered two more BirchClan patrols.” Duskstorm continued as Rustlekit listened eagerly. “On one patrol, we won. And the last patrol we lost.”
_“I remember that.” Dreamheart mewed from where she was listening. “Dawnheart was on that losing patrol, only Dawnpaw then.” The medicine cat’s purple-blue eyes misted over with sadness. “She was bleeding so much, yet all she wanted was to go back and fight them.”
_Duskstorm’s ears pricked, while Glistenfern shot a nervous glance at him, her green gaze flickering to Rustlekit and Whisperkit. Rustlekit tilted his head. Why did Dreamheart sound so sad? And why was Glistenfern nervous? And who was Dawnheart? He didn’t know any cat in ForestClan named Dawnheart. Rustlekit’s green eyes opened wide as a forest. Dawnheart must have been a cat that had died. That was why Dreamheart was so sad.
_The cats in the cave around Rustlekit stared at each other, their eyes full of grief. Then Duskstorm looked back at Rustlekit and, shaking his head to clear it, continued his story.
_“I went on the Sunhigh border patrol with my mentor, Darkshadow, with Blackclaw, and with- with Bramblefrost.” Glistenfern let out a whimper of grief and pressed closer to Duskstorm. Pain shone in Dreamheart’s eyes.
_“I miss my sister.” Dreamheart choked out. Rustlekit felt horrible for her. He couldn’t imagine losing Tawnykit, Ivykit, or Whisperkit.
_“Bramblefrost was my mother.” Glistenfern mewed, her green eyes a forest of sadness. “She was also ForestClan’s deputy. She was the most loyal cat in the clan, not letting Dreamheart give her any herbs to cure her greencough until everyone else had gotten their shares. And now Fernleaf is deputy…” Glistenfern stared out at her father as he organized a patrol. Duskstorm gave her shoulder a few licks.
_“Our patrol ran into a BirchClan hunting patrol.” Duskstorm went on, his dark blue eyes still full of grief at the memories of his lost clanmates. “Leading it was BirchClan’s deputy, Adderflame.”
_“Adderflame!” Fernleaf let out a snort as he stepped into the medicine cat den. “I still can’t believe Honeystar was mouse-brained enough to make that mange-pelt her deputy. Adderflame’s so thoughtlessly aggressive he’d attack a fox for being in the Foxlands!”
_Rustlekit stepped out of the way to allow Fernleaf to go over to Glistenfern and Duskstorm.
_“Are you okay?” Fernleaf asked Duskstorm and his daughter.
_“I’m fine.” Glistenfern replied.
_“I’m okay,” Duskstorm answered. “My wounds don’t hurt too much.”
_Fernleaf turned around to glare sternly at Shimmerstone. The silver tabby she-cat was crouching nervously in the corner of the cave, her purple-blue eyes full of guilt and regret. “Sorrelstar wants to see you.” Shimmerstone dipped her head and slung away, her whiskers drooping. Rustlekit felt a burst of anger. It didn’t matter that she felt sorry. Shimmerstone had attacked his friend!
_“So what happened next?” Rustlekit asked, forgetting his anger in his eagerness to hear the rest of the story.
_“Adderflame ordered his patrol to attack,” Duskstorm continued. “But Bramblefrost told them to stop.”
_“Bramblefrost…” Fernleaf’s eyes clouded at the memory of his mate. Glistenfern pressed closer to her father’s side. Rustlekit shifted his paws nervously. He should let them grieve, but he really wanted to know what happened next.
_“So what did Bramblefrost do?” Rustlekit finally asked.
_“She told Adderflame that they were getting nowhere just fighting each other’s patrols, and they needed to agree on a border.” Duskstorm mewed, his dark blue eyes an ocean of sadness. “She told him they should have a battle. If BirchClan won, they could have the territory up to the Nettle Patch in a straight line from there to where Fox-River flows into Long-River.” Rustlekit opened his mouth to ask what Fox-River was, but Duskstorm had already anticipated his question. “Fox-River comes from the Foxlands and flows into Long-River. It’s the border between ForestClan territory and BirchClan territory down to the Part-Birch Forest.”
_“What did Adderflame say?!” Rustlekit bounced up and down in his excitement.
_“Adderflame said to meet at the Fennel Patch at moonhigh,” Duskstorm continued the story, his eyes full of annoyance. “To see if we could have some of our old territory back. Then he told us to get off his territory. Blackclaw looked like he wanted to rip off his pelt!” Rustlekit could understand that.
_“What happened next?!” Rustlekit mewed excitedly, with a slight tinge of annoyance. Outside, the sun was at the edge of the sky, casting an orange-red glow into the cave-den. And Duskstorm hadn’t even gotten to the battle! At this rate, it would be time for Rustlekit to sleep before Duskstorm was even halfway done with the story!
_“So we went back to camp and told Sorrelstar what had happened.” Duskstorm mewed. “She agreed to-”
_“Dr-Dreamheart, D-Duskstorm?” a voice interrupted. Shimmerstone stood at the entrance to the medicine cat den, her purple-blue eyes full of nervousness and guilt. Rustlekit felt a growl rising in his throat. She attacked his friend. He wasn’t going to forgive her.
_“Yes, Shimmerstone?” Dreamheart looked up from where she and Whisperkit were sorting herbs.
_“S-Sorrelstar wants to s-see b-both of you.” Shimmerstone turned around and walked miserably away to the nursery.
_Dreamheart slipped out of the cave, leaving Whisperkit to finish sorting the herbs. Duskstorm got up to follow, glancing back to give Rustlekit an apologetic look. He hadn’t even reached the part about the battle, Rustlekit thought as Duskstorm left the den. But what did Sorrelstar want to talk to them about? Rustlekit’s green eyes filled with a mischievous curiosity.
_Whisperkit pushed a couple of leaves into another pile before moving to Rustlekit’s side. Rustlekit started out of the den, beckoning to Whisperkit with his tail.
_“Let's spy on them!” Rustlekit whispered excitedly to his brother.
_“Are you sure that’s a good idea?” Whisperkit was doubtful, even looking a little worried. “Isn’t that against the warrior code or something?”
_“It isn’t mentioned in the warrior code.” Rustlekit mewed. “So it should be okay.”
_The two kits crept quietly around the edge of the camp. When they reached the camp entrance, they dashed quickly but quietly past. Soon, they reached the Drink-Puddle, a small pool of water in the corner of the camp for cats to drink out of.
_There were two paths around the Drink-Puddle. One was to go around the pool, away from the camp-wall, but that had a greater risk of being seen. The other way was to carefully balance on a tiny bit of dry ground between the edge of the Drink-Puddle and the camp-wall, but risk falling into the water. Rustlekit, who didn’t want to get wet or be seen, looked to Whisperkit for what to do.
_Whisperkit chose the route on the little bit of ground next to the camp-wall. Rustlekit followed, carefully balancing to stop himself from falling in the Drink-Puddle. Balancing was hard for Rustlekit, because of his twisted leg, so he found that leaning against the camp-wall and slowly moving forward was safer.
_When the two kits were about two thirds of the way to the end of the Drink-Puddle, Fernleaf walked out of the medicine cat den, moving toward the leader’s den. Rustlekit pressed closer to the camp-wall, hoping his fur would blend in with the brown branches of the camp-wall. He looked in front of him to see Whisperkit doing the same. But Whisperkit’s fur was a lighter color, a pale figure against the darker sticks and rocks of the camp-wall. If Fernleaf looked in their direction, he would definitely see Whisperkit.
_Fernleaf kept walking, nearing the leader’s den. Rustlekit felt his hind leg start to slip, losing its grip on the muddy ground. He knew he couldn’t let that hind leg slip, because he needed it to support his twisted hind leg. If that leg slipped, both of his hind-legs would slip, and he would fall into the water.
_Fernleaf reached the leader’s den. Rustlekit let out a soft sigh of relief. But to his horror, Fernleaf didn’t go inside the den. Instead, he crouched down to pick up a shrew from the fresh-kill pile, and turned to go back to the medicine cat den.
_Rustlekit’s paw slid further. He tried to get a grip on the ground, but his claws just slid through the mud, unable to grab hold of anything. His twisted leg started sliding as well, pulled by the weight of his other hind leg. Now Rustlekit was only just barely hanging on by his two front paws. The tip of his tail was touching the cold water below.
_Fernleaf started to turn his head in their direction. He couldn’t look towards them! He couldn’t! Rustlekit started to panic. They had to hide! But where?!
_In his panic, Rustlekit lost his grip and slid into the water. The water! Fernleaf wouldn’t see them there! Rustlekit grabbed Whisperkit’s tail as he slipped. Both kits fell into the water.
_Cold surrounded Rustlekit. He wanted to go up to the surface, but he dug his claws into the stones at the bottom of the Drink-Puddle to stop himself. He could hear Fernleaf’s pawsteps as he walked away. They sounded weird and foggy from underwater. When Rustlekit was sure that Fernleaf was gone, he pushed himself up to the surface.
_Whisperkit had already come out of the water and helped pull Rustlekit up by his scruff.
_“Come on!” Whisperkit urged his brother quietly. “Almost everyone’s in their dens! They won’t see us!”
_The two shivering wet kits huddled next to each other behind the base of the High-Branch’s oak. The leader’s den was dug out underground between the roots of the High-Branch’s oak. From there, hidden behind the oak, Rustlekit could just barely hear cats talking.
_“...is able to hunt and will be able to fight.” Rustlekit recognized Duskstorm’s voice. “He will be able to become a warrior.”
_“And Dreamheart, do you think Whisperkit would be a good medicine cat apprentice?” Rustlekit looked at Whisperkit. They were talking about them!
_“Yes, Sorrelstar.” Dreamheart replied. “He already knows most of the herbs and I don’t think it matters that he was born outside the clans. He has lived in ForestClan since he was half a moon old and he believes in StarClan. I think Whisperkit would be an amazing medicine cat apprentice.”
_“I agree with both of you.” Sorrelstar mewed. “But I as leader have to listen to my clan. If more than half of the clan disagree, I have to listen to them. But otherwise, their apprentice ceremony is tomorrow.”
_Rustlekit no longer felt like a poor wet kit, hiding behind a tree trunk. The last streaks of red light faded from the sky. It was night now. When he woke up it would be dawn. And soon after, he’d finally be an apprentice! And, Rustlekit promised, he’d be the best apprentice in all of the clans!


















































































Apprenticed
_Whisperkit blinked open his eyes. A faint orange-red light shone in from outside the nursery, lightning up the figures of his littermates curled up beside him. A cold breeze blew in from the entrance, bringing the scent of leaf-fall. All was calm and silent.
_The pale gray tom-kit got to his paws. Stepping outside, he saw that the sun had only barely started rising. Whisperkit didn’t usually get up at dawn. He went to sleep quite late. He should have felt tired, yet he felt completely awake. He tipped his head. There was something he was forgetting, wasn’t there?
_His apprentice ceremony! Today Whisperkit would become a medicine cat apprentice!
_Whisperkit jumped around the clearing in excitement. Ever since he was a little kit, he’d wanted to be a medicine cat. When they were only about two moons old, Ivykit got a horrible fever. Dreamheart cured her. Whisperkit had thought that the herbs were interesting, and wanted to know how they worked. He wanted to help other cats, just as Dreamheart had helped his sister. For a while, he just walked around the clearing and glanced into the medicine cat den. He was scared to stay there and watch. He had thought that Dreamheart wouldn’t want him as her apprentice because he wasn’t clan-born. When Whisperkit was just over three moons old, Dreamheart mentioned something about the light-hole that let light into her den. He found that hole and watched Dreamheart from there to learn about herbs. Whisperkit really wanted to be a medicine cat, and now he was going to be one!


/


_“Let all cats old enough to climb their own tree gather here beneath the High-Branch for a clan meeting!”
_Whisperkit dashed outside of the medicine cat den, Dreamheart following more slowly behind. Cats poured out of the dens, gathering around. At the front sat Narrowstream and his littermates, Shiverkit and Shimmerstone nearby. Whisperkit sat down next to Rustlekit and looked eagerly up at his leader.
_“Cats of ForestClan.” Sorrelstar mewed as the last cats sat down. “We are here to welcome five new apprentices. But first, we need to acknowledge Shimmerstone’s breaking of the warrior code, and the two kits that should be becoming apprentices but aren’t.”
_Whisperkit looked behind him to see, through the crowd of cats, Silverkit and Hazekit sitting at the nursery entrance beside their father. He felt sorry for them. This was Shiverkit’s fault, not theirs. Whisperkit shuddered as he glanced at the silver tabby she-kit, quickly looking away before she could glare at him.
_“Shimmerstone broke the warrior code when she attacked Duskstorm and fought Glistenfern.” Sorrelstar continued, giving the silver tabby she-cat a stern look from where she sat beside her daughter. Whisperkit could see the scar Shimmerstone had left on Sorrelstar’s face that day. Shimmerstonee must have been able to see the scar too, Whisperkit guessed, since she refused to look at her leader’s face. “From now on until Duskstorm and Glistenfern are completely healed, Shimmerstone will catch prey for them and Dreamheart and not eat until after they are fed. She will also help Dreamheart gather herbs if necessary, and is confined to camp for the next moon. Shimmerstone,” Sorrelstar looked firmly at the silver-furred queen. “We do not attack our clanmates no matter how angry we are. That is against the warrior code. Do you promise never to hurt a warrior of your clan ever again?”
_“I swear by StarClan I’ll never let myself do anything like that again.” Shimmerstone forced herself to look up at Sorrelstar. Whisperkit felt a little sorry for her. She was angry. She couldn’t control herself.
_“As for Silverkit and Hazekit,” Sorrelstar looked across the clearing towards the nursery. “They will become apprentices one moon later for attacking Tawnykit. Now we are ready to start the ceremony.” Sorrelstar beckoned to the five kits. “Come forward.”
_Whisperkit felt his heart pounding in his chest. He’d been waiting four moons for this. Very soon he would be set on the path to becoming a medicine cat.
_“Shiverkit,” Shiverkit took an excited step forward. “From this moment on, you will be known as Shiverpaw. Your mentor will be Woodstep.”
_“Woodstep,” Sorrelstar turned to the pale brown tabby tom, who hurried through to the front of the gathered cats. “You are ready to take on an apprentice. You are an excellent hunter, and I hope you pass down all you know to Shiverpaw.”
_Woodstep bent down to touch noses with his new apprentice.
_“Shiverpaw! Shiverpaw! Shiverpaw!” ForestClan yowled. Whisperkit and his littermates joined in unenthusiastically. “Shiverpaw!” The name made Whisperkit want to shiver.
_Tawnypaw got apprenticed to Darkshadow, and Ivypaw got apprenticed to Glistenfern. Now it was Rustlekit’s turn.
_“Rustlekit,” Sorrelstar announced. “From this moment on, you will be known as-”
_“Sorrelstar!” Sparrowflight interrupted. “He can’t become an apprentice!”
_“He can’t even walk!” Stalkingleaf spat. Rustlekit pressed against Whisperkit’s side as more cats yowled angry comments at him. Whisperkit felt horrible for his brother. How must he feel, with cats trying to stop him from being what he wanted. If Whisperkit couldn’t become a medicine cat apprentice, he wouldn’t know what he’d do. He felt Rustlekit shaking in anger beside him.
_“I can walk!” Rustlekit yowled with so much rage the clearing went silent. His green eyes were a furious forest. “I can walk, I just walk differently! I can run, I just run differently! Duskstorm taught me to hunt, watch!”
_Rustlekit shoved a stone into the center of the clearing. He began to carefully stalk toward it, his crouch almost perfectly balanced even with his twisted leg. When he was close enough to the stone, Rustlekit pushed forward with his hind legs and flopped on his belly onto the ground, smashing the stone with his front paws. He then picked up the stone in his jaws and turned to face the clan.
_The gathered cats were silent, staring at Rustlekit in shock. Rustlekit glared at them, daring them to speak. He lashed his tail, his brown tabby pelt bristling. Whisperkit thought the clan must be impressed by his brother’s hunting. Rustlekit would become an apprentice! Finally, a voice spoke.
_“Did you see his pounce!” Thornpaw laughed. “It was so terrible you couldn’t even call it a pounce!” Whisperkit felt his hope burn away with those spiteful words. No, they’d never let his brother become an apprentice. Other cats started yowling insults at Rustlekit.
_“You’re only saying that because you’re jealous that you didn’t know how to hunt before you were an apprentice!” Rustlekit spat, but Thornpaw didn’t seem to hear him.
_“He can’t even walk!” Squirrelshade yowled.
_“His crouch was unbalanced!” another voice hissed.
_“I hate all of you!” Rustlekit screeched in fury, but his words were downed out by the rest of the clan. “You’re mangy close-minded unfair mouse-dung eating fox-hearts with bees in your brains and…!” Rustlekit realized that nobody was listening to him.
_Whisperkit started toward his brother.
_“They think I can’t hunt or fight or do anything.” Whisperkit was just close enough to hear Rustlekit hiss to himself. “I showed them I can hunt. I’ll show them I can fight.”
_Rustlekit flung himself across the clearing in the direction of Thornpaw. Whisperkit grabbed his brother’s tail in his jaws to stop him. Rustlekit whipped around with a snarl, his unsheathed claws ready to strike. Whisperkit felt a burst of fear. Rustlekit wouldn’t attack him, would he?! Rustlekit’s eyes flooded with recognition and he sheathed his claws.
_“Let go of me!” Rustlekit spat at his brother.
_“Calm down, Rustlekit.” Whisperkit mewed, afraid of what his brother might do. “You’ll only get yourself into trouble.”
_Rustlekit looked like he wanted to protest, but thought better of it and followed Whisperkit to where they were sitting before. Whisperkit gave his brother a few soothing licks which seemed to calm him down a bit.
_“I think Rustlekit would make an amazing apprentice!” A voice yowled above the snarling of the clan. Whisperkit turned around to see Duskstorm standing defiantly in front of the rest of the clan. “Rustlekit is what every mentor should want.” Duskstorm continued. “An eager apprentice, ready to learn.”
_“If you want the useless rogue-kit as your apprentice, you can have him!” Stalkingleaf snarled, facing the dark brown tom. Most of the clan growled in agreement.
_“Then it’s decided.” Sorrelstar announced. “Rustlekit,” Rustlekit bounded forward. “From this moment on you will be known as Rustlepaw. Duskstorm will be your mentor.”
_“Duskstorm,” Sorrelstar gaze met the gray tinged tom’s dark blue eyes. “You have already proved that you are ready to take on an apprentice in teaching Rustlepaw how to hunt. I trust you to pass on all you know to your new apprentice.”
_“Rustlepaw! Rustlepaw!” Whisperkit yowled. Ivypaw and Tawnypaw joined in. Some of the clan didn’t yowl at all for the new apprentice, and others joined in reluctantly, so Whisperkit tried to yowl twice as loud for Rustlepaw, just as he had done for his sisters. “Rustlepaw! Rustlepaw! Rustlepaw!”
_Sorrelstar turned her gaze to Whisperkit. He felt his heart pounding in his chest. This was it. The moment he became a medicine cat apprentice. “Whisperkit has chosen to take the path of a medicine cat.” Whisperkit’s paw felt light with joy as he leaped forward. Behind him, cats let out gasps of astonishment.
_“But- But Sorrelstar!” A voice mewed. Whisperkit turned around to see Twigtail standing with a shocked look in his green eyes. “He can’t be a medicine cat! He’s not clan-born!”
_The gray-brown tom’s voice echoed around the clearing. The world around Whisperkit seemed to blur. Cats snarled and yowled, but Whisperkit barely heard them. He felt as if he wasn’t there.
_“He doesn’t know about StarClan!”
_“StarClan aren’t his ancestors, he won’t be able to speak to them!”
_“How can a thoughtless rogue know about herbs?!”
_“He’s been learning about herbs!” Whisperkit was vaguely aware of Rustlepaw defending him. Noise rung in his ears, giving his head a dull ache.
_“The clan has spoken.” Sorrelstar’s voice washed over Whisperkit’s ears. “Whisperkit will not become a medicine cat apprentice.” Not be a medicine cat apprentice? That wasn’t right. Whisperkit felt dizzy. Dizziness… Feverfew cured that, didn’t it?
_“Whisperkit, from this moment on, you will be known as Whisperpaw. Your mentor will be…” Sorrelstar paused. Dreamheart, Whisperkit thought. Sorrelstar had to say Dreamheart. That was what was supposed to happen. That couldn’t not happen.
_“Snowyshine.” Sorrelstar finished. That wasn’t right. Whisperkit felt like the world had turned upside down. Nothing was right anymore. Everything, even the air felt wrong.
_“...are an experienced mentor,” Sorrelstar was saying. “And I hope you pass down all you know to Whisperpaw.”
_Whisperkit looked confusedly around the clearing. Why was everyone staring so expectantly at him? He realized Snowyshine was standing in front of him, her head lowered to the same level as his face. They had to touch noses, Whisperkit remembered. He should do that, shouldn’t he? He lifted his head slowly to touch noses with Snowyshine. His head felt heavy, and he let it fall back down to look at the ground.
 _“Whisperpaw! Whisperpaw! Whisperpaw!” Whisperkit -no, Whisperpaw- stared nauseously at the other cats. He should be excited at his new name. But he just felt… nothing.
_“Whisperpaw?” Tawnypaw walked over to him. “Are you okay?”
_Whisperpaw stared blankly at his sister. He wasn’t going to become a medicine cat. Nothing would ever be okay.


























Into The Forest
_The sun shone through the clouds at the top of the sky, a cold leaf-fall breeze blowing through the camp as the gathered cats dispersed, going back to their dens and leaving on patrols. Darkshadow, Woodstep, and Snowyshine started toward the camp entrance. Shiverpaw walked beside her mentor, while Rustlepaw and Tawnypaw bounded ahead in their excitement. Ivypaw lagged behind, Whisperpaw trailing even further behind her.
_As Ivypaw stepped through the hole in the camp-wall, she remembered the last time she’d been out of camp with a shudder. Shiverkit had been chasing her, ready to rip fur and flesh.
_The new apprentices followed their mentors through the forest. Ahead of them, Ivypaw could hear a growling noise. She felt a tremor of fear. What were their mentors leading them towards?! Was it some evil hungry creature, ready to eat them?! After going about twenty or thirty fox-lengths, they came to a place where the ground grew muddy, filled with pebbles and stones. The ground sloped down, leading to a terrifying sight.
_Water thundered past, more than half as wide as ForestClan’s camp. It was as if all the raindrops in the sky were swept into an enormous rush of water, blowing across the ground in a deadly storm. The middle was a raging current, ready to sweep away any cat that dared to swim in it. The loud roaring of the river echoed in Ivypaw’s ears.
_“This is Wide-River.” Snowyshine announced. The five new apprentices gathered around Snowyshine while Darkshadow and Woodstep stood a fox-length away. “As you can see, Wide-River is very wide.”
_“As if we didn’t know that.” Ivypaw muttered with a flick of her black tail. Tawnypaw gave her a look, telling her to be quiet.
_“Wide-River goes along half of our territory.” Snowyshine continued. “The only easy place to cross it is the Fallen-Oak, an oak tree that fell over across the river.”
_Snowyshine turned to walk along the riverbank, flicking her fluffy tail through the air to tell the apprentices to follow her. Ahead of Ivypaw, the other three apprentices stared up at the trees around them in amazement, as if they couldn’t believe there were that many trees in the world. She didn’t care about the trees. They were just boring old trees! Why get excited over some random lumps of wood sticking out of the ground?! Besides, she already knew there were lots and lots of trees. Ivypaw tipped her head in confusion. How did she know that? She shook out her pelt. Who cared about a bunch of trees?!
_Ivypaw watched the cats ahead of her, three mentors and three apprentices. Suddenly, she felt like an outcast, left to roam the forest alone. She could catch up with them, but she knew that would only make her feel more out of place. A shadow, lost in the warmth of the sunlight… 
_There was something odd about the six cats just ahead of her that made Ivypaw’s fur prickle. What was wrong? It was just three mentors and three apprentices, exploring the territory. Three apprentices?! Ivypaw’s forest green eyes opened wide in alarm. Where was Whisperpaw?!
_The black and white she-cat turned around to see her brother trailing along two fox-lengths behind her. His whiskers drooped, his dull blue eyes starring sightlessly at the ground. Whisperpaw stumbled over a root and scraped his paw on a stone. A glimmer of fear past through Ivypaw’s eyes when he continued on as if he hadn’t even felt the pain.
_“Dock for scratched pads.” Whisperpaw mumbled to himself.
_“Ivypaw, Whisperpaw, hurry up!” Ivypaw turned back around to see Darkshadow standing in front of a gigantic boulder.
_The rock seemed to rise all the way to the sky, its jagged sides smoothing over at the top, high above the trees. Moss littered the base of the giant rock, water splashing furiously against its sides. The group of cats walked beside the river by it, the stony wall never seeming to end. Finally, they got to a much calmer part of the river, where the boulder seemed to curve around away from them.
_“The boulder we just past is called Riversplit-Rock.” Darkshadow told the apprentices. Rustlepaw and Tawnypaw bounced around excitedly, while Shiverpaw tried to look calm, though her sky blue eyes betrayed her excitement. “It splits Wide-River into two separate rivers, Long-River and Lower-River. This river right here,” Darkshadow flicked his tail toward the calmer river beside them that was only about six fox-lengths wide. “Is Lower-River. Is goes directly down-hill while Long-River flows all the way across the other clans’ territories and into the Twolegplace.”
_On the other side of Riversplit-Rock, Ivypaw noticed she could see Long-River, its quick current almost as dangerous as Wide-River’s. The ruthless splashing of the water faded away as the eight cats continued on walking beside Lower-River.
_Ivypaw walked along, the cold wind washing over her sleek white and black pelt. She liked the cold and the dark. As a tiny kit, she could remember being curled up in the freezing cold nursery at night, everything so dark she could barely see. She remembered the warmth of the cats around her, yet still the comforting cold shadows keeping her cool in the den. But the nursery wasn’t that dark! Or that cold, even at night! Ivypaw narrowed her eyes in confusion. Maybe she was remembering a different place…
_As Ivypaw continued to follow the other cats, she noticed that more and more of the trees in the forest were birch trees. Would they eventually reach a forest made only of birch trees? Rustlepaw dashed ahead in his excitement, and Tawnypaw ran after him. Why were they so excited, Ivypaw wondered with an irritated flick of her tail. They were just wandering through some forest and seeing some random places. She remembered traveling far, seeing many distinct plants and landforms. What was so interesting about a bunch of plants? They did nothing to stop a cat from feeling miserable.
_“Stop!” Snowyshine yowled. Ahead, Rustlepaw and Tawnypaw halted, turning around to look at the white-furred she-cat. Snowyshine and the rest of the cats caught up to where Rustlepaw and Tawnypaw were. A disgusting scent hit Ivypaw’s nose.
_The scent was a little like mud, and grass, and plants on the ground. Sort of… earthy, though it did smell quite a lot like the ForestClan cats, of the wind, sky, and mostly of tree bark. The scent would have been fine if it hadn’t been tinged with an unfamiliar sourness, something like crow-food. The dreadful smell was mixed with cat scent, as if a cat had put it there.
_“This is the BirchClan border.” Snowyshine told the apprentices. She signaled to Woodstep to continue telling them about BirchClan.
_“BirchClan is one of the other three clans.” Woodstep mewed. “They live in the Birch Forest and the Part-Birch Forest on the other side of the border. BirchClan cats climb trees like us, but they like to- I mean they are uh… more muscular than us, but that makes them heavier and less agile than us, so they can’t balance as well in trees and spend more time on the ground.”
_Snowyshine nodded to the young tom in approval. Having been made a warrior only seven moons before, Ivypaw realized, Woodstep must not have had an apprentice before. The light brown tabby tom didn’t seem to be very good at teaching, probably since he didn’t have much experience.
_The cats kept walking on and on. Ivypaw’s legs started to ache, her paws hurting from stepping on sharp stones and thorns. Ahead of her, Tawnypaw and Rustlepaw let out squeaks of excitement, while she tried not to listen to Whisperpaw’s grumbling.
_“Traveling herbs…” her brother mumbled from behind her. “They’d help with walking. What were they again? I remember sorrel, and those other herbs, the ones with white flowers… Daisy, definitely, and whatever that fourth herb was…”
_Ivypaw let out a miserable groan. Here she was, walking until her paws fell off with two irritatingly happy kits, a grumbling cat who wouldn’t shut up, a mentor who didn’t know how to explain stuff and, Ivypaw shivered, a cat that might tear her pelt off the moment she was out of sight. How wonderful being an apprentice was, Ivypaw thought with a lash of her black tail.
_“Along the borders,” Snowyshine mewed after a while. “There are certain places where we put scent marks. For example, this rock.” Snowyshine flicked her tail toward a rock about a tail length tall which had a sharp edge on one side. Just behind the rock, Ivypaw scented the foul smell of BirchClan’s scent marker and moved away with a sniff.
_The cats continued on until they reached a strange wall that came out of the ground. The wall was made of unnatural looking silver tendrils that were woven together. The gaps between the silver tendrils were very small, only big enough for bugs and spiders. Nearby to the left, the wall turned at an angle. Tawnypaw experimented with the strange unnatural wall, trying to see if she could fit one of her paws through the gaps.
_“What is this?!” Rustlepaw asked, turning to the three mentors.
_“This,” Darkshadow answered. “Is a silver-wall. Instead of using scent markers like us, twolegs use silver-walls to mark the borders of their territories. Woodstep, could you tell us about where the silver-wall turns and about the other clans?”
_Woodstep nodded and turned to speak to the apprentices.
_“This is where all four of the clans’ territories meet.” Woodstep told them, speaking as if he were an apprentice himself, answering a question his mentor asked him. “Farther down-hill, is VioletClan territory. VioletClan lives in a meadow with lots of- mostly of violets. They smell like flowers and- and mostly like violets. They’re very fast because they mostly eat rabbits because… because they live on their territory?” Woodstep looked to Snowyshine and Darkshadow for approval.
_The two older cats exchanged a doubtful glance, before looking back at Woodstep.
_“And TunnelClan?” Snowyshine asked.
_“TunnelClan!” Woodstep exclaimed, having forgotten to mention it. Ivypaw flicked her tail in annoyance. Any cat would think he was nine moons old, not nineteen! “TunnelClan lives in the tunnels underground. Their scent is… a lot like the ground. They are faster than VioletClan, since they have to travel farther because their territory in the tunnels goes all over the clan territory so they have to be faster to get anywhere at all- it even goes beyond clan territory! They have a little bit of territory above ground so they can get herbs.”
_Shiverpaw opened her mouth to say something, but Tawnypaw spoke before her.
_“But don’t the tunnels lead to holes in our territory where they can easily climb out and steal prey?”
_“Yes,” Snowyshine replied. “We place scent markers around any holes we find to tell them that this is our territory, not theirs.”
_Tawnypaw nodded in agreement, while Shiverpaw gave her an icy glare. Ivypaw was pretty sure that Shiverpaw was going to say the exact thing that Tawnypaw said, and now she was angry that Tawnypaw had got the credit for the idea. Shiverpaw hadn’t said or done anything horrible, Ivypaw realized. Then her green gaze darkened. She hadn’t done anything, yet.






















































Climb
_Almost a quarter moon had past since Rustlepaw and his littermates became apprentices. For the first time in three days, the sun shone down from the sky, only a few rainless clouds hovering above. The brown tabby apprentice bounced around excitedly just outside the warriors’ den, waiting for his mentors to wake up. Two days before, Darkshadow had promised he’d teach the apprentices how to climb when the trees were dry. And now, almost halfway to sunhigh, the trees would definitely be dry.
_Pawsteps thudded behind Rustlepaw, and he turned around, hoping to see one of his temporary mentors. Instead it was Squirrelshade stepping out of the den. He let out an impatient sigh and started toward the medicine cat den on the other side of the camp.
_Inside the cave, Duskstorm lay curled up asleep in his nest. Dreamheart spoke to Glistenfern, while Whisperpaw sorted the herbs. From the sleepiness in his brother’s eyes, Rustlepaw could tell that Whisperpaw had been awake before dawn, trying to get as much time in the medicine cat den as possible.
_“Rustlepaw!” Dreamheart mewed when she noticed him. “Glistenfern’s wounds are healed enough for her to go back to her warrior duties. Can you tell Ivypaw?”
_“Sure!” Rustlepaw mewed before dashing over to the apprentices’ den. The apprentices’ den was made of sticks and stones, woven together with mud around two small dogwoods. The den was sort of divided into two halves, the place where the apprentices slept, and the place where the horrible fox-hearts slept. Rosepaw and Thornpaw slept in the back corner of the fox-heart side of the den, Shiverpaw having plenty of space in the other corner. Mistypaw and Mewpaw shared a nest together in the corner of the not horrible side of the den closer to the entrance, while their brother Herringpaw slept right in the middle of the den. Rustlepaw and his littermates slept in a giant pile of moss in the back corner. Ivypaw was curled up, sound asleep, while Tawnypaw cleaned the moss off of her pelt.
_“Hi, Rustlepaw!” Tawnypaw mewed excitedly to her brother.
_“Can’t you be a bit quieter?” Mewpaw grumbled irritably from where she was curled up in the other corner. “I’m trying to get some sleep after the dawn patrol.”
_“Sorry.” Tawnypaw mewed, lowering her voice.
_“Ivypaw,” Rustlepaw nudged his sister with a paw. “Wake up!”
_“Go away!” Ivypaw complained, with an annoyed twitch of her tail. “I’m trying to sleep!”
_“You already slept.” Tawnypaw mewed.
_“Well I’m tired,” Ivypaw hissed iritably, curling up with her back to her littermates. “And I want to sleep.”
_“Ivypaw,” Rustlepaw urged. “It’s already halfway to sunhigh!”
_“Really?!” Ivypaw’s ears pricked up. “Then I should try to sleep as much as I can before our mentors come!” The black and white she-cat buried her face into the pile of moss she was sleeping on.
_“Ivypaw!” Rustlepaw mewed impatiently. “Glistenfern is-”
_“I don’t care!” Ivypaw interrupted, her voice muffled by the moss. “Let me sleep!”
_“This is hopeless.” Tawnypaw muttered. “Rustlepaw, should we see if our mentors are ready for training. Then she’ll have to get up!”
_Rustlepaw nodded and the two cats headed out of the den. Outside, cats lay around the clearing and in the trees, enjoying the sunlight while it lasted. Some cats gathered around Fernleaf, ready to go on patrols. Just a few fox-lengths away from them, Snowyshine, Darkshadow, Woodstep, and Glistenfern waited.
_“Tawnypaw, Rustlepaw!” Glistenfern purred when she saw them. “We were wondering  where you were!”
_“I’ll get Ivypaw, you get Whisperpaw.” Tawnypaw mewed, before bounding away to the apprentices’ den. Rustlepaw limp-ran toward the medicine cat den. Soon he’d be learning to climb!


/


_Rustlepaw followed his mentors excitedly through the forest. Around him, shadows dappled the ground. He looked up to see the green leaves of the trees shining brightly in the sunlight. Tawnypaw bounced along beside him, equally excited to learn to climb. Finally, the group of cats stopped beside a bunch of maple trees.
_“Here,” Snowyshine instructed. “We will split into two groups. “Darkshadow, Glistenfern, Ivypaw, Tawnypaw, and Rustlepaw will stay here. Woodstep, Shiverpaw, Whisperpaw, and I will go to a different place so that we all have plenty of space to climb.”
_Darkshadow led the way into the group of maple trees. The black-furred tom stopped beside one of them and waited for the other four cats to gather around. Rustlepaw, who felt like leaping around in excitement, forced himself to sit down and gazed up at Darkshadow.
_“Climbing,” Darkshadow told the three apprentices. “Is a lot like walking, except you’re moving up instead of forward. To climb, you have to dig your claws into the bark to stop yourself from falling.”
_Glistenfern stepped up to a tree and began to demonstrate how to climb. First, she moved her front paws up the tree until she was standing on her hind legs. Then, just as Darkshadow had said, she climbed up the tree just as a cat would walk on the ground.
_“Why don’t you try!” Glistenfern mewed to the apprentices.
_Rustlepaw dashed over to the nearest tree. Unsheathing his claws, he dug his front paws into the bark and moved them higher and higher until he was standing on his hindlegs. Using his mentors’ advice, Rustlepaw moved his left front paw and his untwisted right hind paw upwards, just as he’d do as if he were walking. Darkshadow watched nervously from the ground a few fox-lengths away. He thought Rustlepaw couldn’t climb! The brown tabby tom narrowed his eyes in determination. He could climb. He’d show them. He lifted his other two paws up. Next, gripping the trunk with his twisted hind paw and his right front paw, he began to move his left front paw and his untwisted hind up, but that was where things went wrong. Rustlepaw’s twisted paw was gripping the trunk at an angle, so it didn’t have a very good grip. Most of his weight was put on his right front paw, which was too much for it. Rustlepaw’s paw slipped.
_He lashed out at the trunk with his other two paws, but all he managed to do was push himself further away from the trunk. Rustlepaw fell over backwards. His twisted paw still gripped the tree, and it twisted painfully as he fell. A sharp pain burst through his toe, and his breath was knocked out of him as he hit the ground with a thud.
_“Rustlepaw!” Glistenfern dashed to his side. “Are you okay?!”
_Rustlepaw rolled onto his side. His leg hurt and his toe throbbed. “I think I twisted my twisted leg, and my toe really hurts.”
_Glistenfern examined his leg and paw. “Your leg looks okay,” The brown and golden she-cat mewed. “Though your claw is a bit twisted. It’s bleeding a little but it should be fine.”
_Rustlepaw looked up at the other trees where his sisters were climbing. Tawnypaw was already halfway up her tree, and even Ivypaw who was panting with the effort had managed to climb a few cat-lengths. Rustlepaw stared hopelessly at his tree. His sisters were far above the ground while he only got a tail-length up before he fell down. Maybe he’d never be able to climb.
_No, Rustlepaw thought fiercely, getting to his paws. His toe burst with pain, but he barely felt it. He could climb, and he would climb. Rustlepaw’s eyes shone with determination as he stalked up to the tree. His three good paws stood firmly on the ground. He could do this.
_Rustlepaw pushed off of the ground with his hindlegs. Since he couldn’t push as hard with his twisted leg, he went sideways, but fastened his front claws into the trunk before he fell too far away. Then, surely but carefully, he began to climb the tree. Rustlepaw moved one paw at a time in a repeated rhythm, dragging his twisted leg behind him and keeping a good grip on the tree. Below him, the ground grew farther and farther away. A burst of excitement flashed through him. He was climbing!
_Rustlepaw gripped the tree with his front paws and moved his untwisted hind leg again, lifting his left front paw up as his hind paw touched the bark. A jolt of pure terror burst through Rustlepaw as the bark crumbled away between his hind paw’s claws. For a moment he clung to the tree only by his right front paw. Just as before. Bark broke beneath his paw, and he began to fall. Again.
_He had failed. He was doomed to fall, every time. Air rushed around him as he slipped. The clan would laugh at him, tell him he’d never be a warrior. And they would be right. No, Rustlepaw thought, lashing out at the tree bark with his claws. He wouldn’t fall again. He could do this.
_Rustlepaw’s claws dug deep into wood a fox-length and a half above ground. He had done it! He hadn’t fallen! He climbed upwards, more carefully, yet faster and with spirit. He could do this, Rustlepaw thought. He knew it with all of his heart.
_Before he knew it, he had reached a place where the tree forked into separate branches, and settled there to rest. In the tree next to him, Tawnypaw scrambled up into the place on her tree where the trunk forked. Ivypaw struggled at her tree, but finally, after a really long time, she got to the fork in her tree.
_Darkshadow stared up at Rustlepaw in amazement, while Glistenfern watched him proudly. So what if he had failed his first attempt, and almost fell the second time?! So what if he couldn’t use his twisted leg?! He had found a way around it. His leg hadn’t stopped him. It hadn’t before, and it never would. Nothing, not anything, could ever stop Rustlepaw from becoming a warrior!




Broken Dreams
_The rising sun cast rays of red light over the clearing, looking like a bleeding wound. A cut at the edge of the sky. A scratch that could be healed with herbs. If only Whisperpaw had become a medicine cat apprentice…
_The sun rose further as Whisperpaw sat there, all alone in the still cold air. The orange-red light of dawn. The clouds covering the sky, a mass of pink. He remembered seeing that same sight. It had only been thirteen days ago, but it felt like a lifetime. Almost half a moon ago, the day all of Whisperpaw’s dreams had been broken.
_A few cats yawned as they stepped out of the warriors’ den for the dawn patrol. When Whisperpaw saw that one of them was Stalkingleaf, he hurried away into the medicine cat den. Inside the cave, Duskstorm slept soundlessly. All of his wounds except the scar on his flank had healed, and Dreamheart had said that he would be able to go back to his warrior duties in a few more days. Dreamheart stirred in her nest.
_“Whisperpaw?” She mewed, getting to her paws. “Hi, Whisperpaw. Could you organize the herbs?”
_“Sure.” Whisperpaw replied, and got to work pushing leaves into small holes in the cave floor. He picked up a yellow flower which he identified as a dandelion by the thinness of it's petals. Good for bee stings, he remembered. A while ago, Rosepaw had come back from a hunting patrol covered in stings. She had said that a bee had stung Thornpaw while he was hunting a shrew, and she thought that the bees needed to be taught a lesson. Next, he rolled a few juniper berries into their hole. Every once in a while, Eaglewing would have a coughing fit and need juniper berries to help him breathe. Whisperpaw kept putting herbs into their places, until he came across a herb he didn’t know.
_“Dreamheart, what’s this?” Whisperpaw asked, and looked back down to study the herb that lay at his paws. The herb’s leaves resembled ferns, though he could tell that they couldn’t be ferns by their jagged edges. Also, they smelled different from the ferns in the light-hole.
_“Those are ragwort leaves.” Dreamheart licked that last bit of moss from her pelt. “Just like burnet, they give cats more strength and energy. They are also pretty good for aching joints, though daisy is better. It makes a good substitute for burnet or daisy in the traveling herb mixture, though we always have plenty of daisy in our territory.”
_Whisperpaw gave the fern-like ragwort leaves a good sniff to smell their scent, before putting them into their hole. He sorted through many leaves, flowers, roots, and seeds of different shapes, sizes, and scents. By the time he had finished, the orange-red light of dawn had faded away. The clouds darkened with rain. It was daytime.
_“What do I do now?” Whisperpaw asked Dreamheart.
_“Well,” Dreamheart got up from where she had been sitting. “There isn’t anything else to do here, but we could go and get some herbs before your training starts. Which herbs do you think we should find?”
_Whisperpaw tipped his head in thought. They were rather low on mallow, juniper, and ragwort. But they should get mallow later at sunhigh when the leaves were the driest, so Dreamheart could get mallow leaves later. As for juniper berries, Eaglewing’s coughing would be worse in the colder seasons, so they should definitely get plenty. Ragwort didn’t seem to be a herb they needed badly, so they could just keep a look out for it along with any other herbs. Whisperpaw knew it was good to grab as many herbs as possible before they started to die around the middle of leaf-fall. Now what herbs would be necessary to cure sicknesses and diseases that came in leaf-bare? Catmint of course. But to get catmint, they’d have to travel all the way to the other side of VioletClan’s territory. ForestClan didn’t share a border with the Twolegplace, the only place where catmint grew. They could go to BirchClan, who had a border with it, but BirchClan would tear their pelts off. So instead they would have to walk all the way to VioletClan’s Twolegplace border. Whisperpaw wouldn’t be able to come as well because he was a new apprentice and because there wouldn’t be enough time to go there and back before training. Training, Whisperpaw thought with a shudder. He hated training.
_“We’re running out of juniper berries.” Whisperpaw answered Dreamheart’s question. The medicine cat nodded.
_“Ragwort and burnet would be good to get as well.” the dark brown tabby she-cat suggested. “I give them to cats with greencough to keep their strength up so that they can fight the disease.”
_Dreamheart turned toward the entrance of the den and signaled to Whisperpaw with a flick of her tail for him to follow. But just as the two cats were about to leave, Snowyshine stepped into the den. The joyful expression on his face melted away.
_“Hi Whisperpaw,” Snowyshine mewed. “We’re going to start training now so that we get a bit more practice climbing before it rains.”
_Dreamheart gave Whisperpaw a sorry look as the pale gray apprentice followed his mentor out into the clearing. Training. He hated it with all his heart.


/


_Whisperpaw trailed after the rest of the cats as they walked through the forest. Clouds covered the sky, their dullness echoing his misery. With every pawstep, dread filled his heart. Every hair on his pelt tugged at him to go back. He remembered how happy and excited he was, only half a moon before. Every morning was like this. Every day, he could hear the yowls of his clanmates snarling at him to his doom. His doom, walking through the forest every day, learning to hunt and fight. He should be in camp sorting herbs, not learning to become a warrior. It just wasn’t right.
_The cats paused for a moment. Whisperpaw thought they were deciding how to split up into two groups, but he was too miserable to care. Eventually, the cats continued on, half of them going off in a different direction.
_A loud roaring sound told Whisperpaw that they were walking along Wide-River. He didn’t bother to look where he was going. He just moved one paw in front of the other. Why? Why did training have to start earlier that day? Why couldn’t the clan let him be a medicine cat apprentice? What had he ever done to deserve this? Exist? Probably, Whisperpaw thought with a whimper. Most of ForestClan seemed to think that.
_In front of Whisperpaw, the other cats stopped. An oak lay across the water, the Fallen-Oak. Moss clung to the tree’s bark where it touched the water, its torn roots a mass of tangles rising at least seven fox-lengths above the ground. On the other side of the bank, the oak’s lifeless brown leaves were splayed out, shriveled up and dead.
_Snowyshine climbed easily up the roots, beckoning to Whisperpaw to follow. The pale gray apprentice followed her, clumps of mud falling off under his paws. When he reached the top, he stepped onto the trunk to wait for Rustlepaw to climb up.
_Whisperpaw looked down. The ground seemed to be very far below. He sunk his claws deeper into the bark, his gloominess dampened by a tinge of fear. He hated training. He feared training. Not only because it took him away from his herbs, not only because it led him away from the path of a medicine cat, but because he was terrified of heights. Whisperpaw didn’t dare let the clan know this. What would they think? A ForestClan cat that was afraid of heights?! ForestClan was known for hunting and fighting high up in the trees. They’d never accept a mouse-heart that was scared of heights like him.
_Tawnypaw followed Rustlepaw up, Darkshadow scrambling up the roots behind them. Seeing that everyone had made it to the top of the roots, Snowyshine started forward. Whisperpaw slowly followed after her.
_Whisperpaw dug his claws hard into the tree bark with each step, absolutely terrified of falling. He could just imagine the feeling of the ground slipping away beneath his paws, and then falling, falling, falling into the deadly current and being swept away forever… Whisperpaw shuddered. It was a very small movement, but that was all it took. His hind paw slipped. A sharp burst of terror stabbed his heart. But he didn’t fall. Whisperpaw quickly got back to his paws and continued on, his paws shaking.
_With each step, he felt the wind rushing at him, bursts of air threatening to knock him off of his paws. And then he would fall, and fall… and fall… No, Whisperpaw told himself with a burst of confidence. He wouldn’t let himself fall. He would make it to the other side of the oak. He would be okay. Whisperpaw’s sky blue eyes brightened with determination and he quickened his pawsteps, moving at a faster pace. He’d crossed this oak-bridge four times before and not fallen, so why should he fall this time. But still, the current raged below him…
_Finally, Whisperpaw reached the end of the Fallen-Oak. He carefully followed his mentor down the lifeless branches onto the ground. The solid earth beneath his paws was comforting. There, a gentle breeze couldn’t blow him off his paws and down, down, down into a deadly river. But as he continued on with the rest of the training patrol, Whisperpaw knew that the worst was yet to come.


/


_Whisperpaw stood at the base of the birch tree, staring up at it. Black splotched white branches stretched high into the sky. Nearby, Tawnypaw and Rustlepaw climbed excitedly up their birch trees. They were excited? How? Whisperpaw looked back up at the tree. Any cat who wanted to climb up there must have bees in their brain! But he knew his littermates didn’t have bees in their brains. But then why were they so excited about risking falling to their deaths?
_But no matter how scared he was, Whisperpaw had to climb. He couldn’t show his fear. What would ForestClan do to him if they thought he couldn’t be a medicine cat or a warrior?! He had to climb. If he climbed, he would eventually make it back down safely. But if he showed his fear, he would probably be sent away to starve to death, unable to find a place in the clan.
_Whisperpaw told himself to ignore his feelings of fear and misery. He had found that if he just mindlessly did what he was told, everything would go by a little bit faster. Pretending he was just dreaming also helped. He could just think the whole training session was a nightmare that would be over in the morning.
_Climb the tree, Whisperpaw ordered himself. He began to climb up towards where the birch forked. Don’t think, he told himself. If he thought anything, he would be snapped back into panicking and worrying about falling to his death. When he reached a fork in the tree, he went to the branch furthest on his left and continued doing that mindlessly.
_Whisperpaw climbed for such a long time that he was starting to get nervous about how high he was. He had never gone this high before. Would he be able to keep calm if he looked down? Stop worrying, he demanded to himself. He had to stop thinking, to stop being aware of how terrifyingly high up he was. He had to be oblivious of everything, everything except the branch beneath his paws. Eventually, the branches started to get thinner and thinner until the next one he went onto bent slightly beneath his weight. This was high enough, he decided.
_The branch leaned more. Whisperpaw climbed back down a bit to a steadier branch, his paws tingling with nervousness. How high up was he? He shouldn’t worry about that, he told himself. He was doing fine.
_“Whisperpaw!” Snowyshine called from below. “That was excellent climbing!”
_Whisperpaw looked down at his mentor. That was a mistake.
_He was so high up that Snowyshine looked as small as a tiny white yarrow flower. He was so high above the ground. The wind that blew against him suddenly felt colder and stronger, trying to blow him off of the tree. Whisperpaw’s heart raced in his chest and he wrapped his paws around the branch like a kit clinging to its mother. The wind howled in his ears and he closed his eyes as the branch bobbed up and down from his weight and the wind. He could sense the nothingness beneath him, and how if he let go, he would fall, fall, fall… He couldn’t move. He didn’t dare open his eyes. All he wanted was to be back on the safe ground, not up here in this deadly place. He had never been more terrified in his life.
_A warm flank pressed against his side, and Whisperpaw started to calm down as a cat gently licked his shoulder. His heartbeat slowed and the branch seemed to shake less.
_“You’re safe now, little one.” The strange she-cat mewed, her voice soft and soothing. “I won’t let you fall.”
_Whisperpaw slowly backed down the tree, the strange she-cat by his side. When he finally dared to open his eyes, he saw that the she-cat had long blue-gray fur that glittered with stars, her golden eyes calm and reassuring. Finally, after a long time, his hind paws hit the ground.
_“Goodbye, little one.” The strange she-cat mewed, fading away until nothing but her starry outline was left. “Stay safe.”
_Whisperpaw sat down on the ground, the grass feeling soft and comforting. He could sense the endless earth beneath him. He had gotten back down. He was safe.
_“Whisperpaw,” Tawnypaw ran over to him, Rustlepaw just behind. “Are you okay?”
_The pale gray tom blinked at his littermates, too shaken to reply. The ground seemed strangely low around him, but not low enough. Whisperpaw’s legs ached, and he let himself flop over. He could feel all the way to the stone in the ground. Stone, grass, earth keeping him safe. He wanted to stay there forever.
_“Whisperpaw?” he looked up to see Snowyshine and Darkshadow walking towards him.
_“I-I got kind of sc-scared.” Whisperpaw told his mentors. “The branch I cl-climbed onto was so th-thin that it m-moved. I was so h-high up, and I thought I was g-going to f-f-fall!”
_“Then make sure to stay away from the thinner branches.” Snowyshine gave her apprentice a lick between his ears. “You’re safe now.”
_Whisperpaw waited for a moment, but nobody mentioned the strange blue-gray she-cat that had helped him get down. He tilted his head, his pale blue eyes full of confusion. That cat had disappeared! How can a cat fade away?! His eyes widened for a moment. Maybe she was a StarClan cat! There had been stars in her fur…
_An icy cold drop of water fell onto Whisperpaw’s pelt. More followed soon after. Whisperpaw liked to think that he liked the rain. It helped the herbs and the forest grow. But in reality, he hated it as much as every other cat.
_“Why don’t we do a bit of battle training?” Darkshadow suggested. Snowyshine nodded and the five cats set off, their fur getting wetter and wetter as they walked along beneath the trees.
_They had been traveling for quite a while when Whisperpaw scented something through the rain. A herb! What was it… Burnet? He paused to push the soggy grass away to see what it was. A clump of burnet grew out of the ground, easily recognizable by its fern-like shape and its round leaves. Burnet! Just what Dreamheart had been wanting to find! Whisperpaw bent down to nip off some stems.
_“Whisperpaw, hurry up!” Snowyshine complained, stepping over to where he was.
_“I’m getting some herbs Dreamheart said she needed.” Whisperpaw replied.
_“But you can’t drag those leaves all the way to the Training-Clearing.” Snowyshine mewed. “You’re a warrior apprentice,” She reminded him. “Not a medicine cat.”
_Whisperpaw trailed after his mentor, reluctantly leaving the herb behind. It didn’t seem right, leaving a herb they needed just lying there when he could easily take some back to camp. But nothing seemed right anymore. He wasn’t meant to be a warrior! He was supposed to be a medicine cat! But those fox-hearted mouse-brains didn’t care about what was supposed to happen. Whisperpaw’s eyes narrowed with hurt and a tinge of anger. They didn’t listen, and they never would.


/


_Whisperpaw’s pelt was thoroughly drenched by the time they got to the Training-Clearing. And more rain still poured down. No one cared, he thought miserably. No one but the clouds in the sky, echoing his sadness.
_“The first move we will learn,” Snowyshine told the three apprentices. “Is the duck-and-roll defensive move.”
_“I already know that move!” Rustlepaw purred, bouncing around with excitement.
_“Rustlepaw,” Darkshadow mewed. “Why don’t you practice all the battle moves you know, while Snowyshine and I train Whisperpaw and Tawnypaw.”
_The brown tabby apprentice leaped away and began pouncing and clawing at the air. Tawnypaw watched, tearing bits of grass from the ground in her impatience. Darkshadow watched Rustlepaw’s moves in amazement, as Snowyshine turned to Tawnypaw. Whisperpaw sighed. As usual, no one cared about him.
_Snowyshine and Darkshadow demonstrated the move. Tawnypaw watched eagerly, but Whisperpaw just stared past them dismally. Why couldn’t he have brought the burnet with him? Why did he have to go to these useless training lessons? He wasn’t good at climbing or hunting or fighting. He was good at healing. It was so mouse-brained not to have him be a medicine cat! He should do what he’s good at, not have his skills wasted! The unfairness of everything and the fact he couldn’t change anything about it made Whisperpaw feel like he had a huge hole torn into his heart. The miserable despair that flowed like blood out of it… He watched as Tawnypaw jumped about, asking Darkshadow a question. Couldn’t they sense it? He could feel the aching sadness rising out of his heart and into the air. Did they care about him at all?! Or did they-
_Whisperpaw’s breath was knocked out of him as paws slammed down onto his back, knocking him off of his paws. A paw pressed down onto his neck, pinning him. He looked up to see Snowyshine glaring down at him with an irritated look in her purple-blue eyes.
_“And that,” his mentor growled, letting Whisperpaw back up. “Is what happens when a warrior isn’t paying attention during a battle.”
_“S-Sorry.” Whisperpaw’s mew was almost a whimper. No, they didn’t care. Not at all.
_“Tell me when you’ve regained your focus.” Snowyshine hissed. “Then we can practice the defensive move.”
_The defensive move! Whisperpaw hadn’t been paying attention! He didn’t know what it was! He looked toward where Tawnypaw and Darkshadow were training. Darkshadow leaped at Tawnypaw, but Tawnypaw crouched down and rolled away unsteadily, landing on her side.
_“I’m ready.” Whisperpaw mewed. Snowyshine pounced at him without warning, her paws aiming to land on his back just like the last time. Whisperpaw ducked down, but it was too late. Snowyshine’s paws landed hard on his back and she flipped him over, pinning him.
_“Next time move a bit faster.” Snowyshine let Whisperpaw back up, before they tried the move again. This time he moved the moment his mentor went up into the air. Once he was in a crouch, he pushed off with his right legs in an attempt to roll. But Snowyshine was coming toward him so fast that he didn’t have enough time to complete his roll, and she pinned him again.
_“Not fast enough.” Snowyshine hissed. “Are you sure you’re focused?!”
_Not fast enough?! How was Whisperpaw supposed to be any faster?! He was already moving as fast as he could! He watched Tawnypaw perform the move almost perfectly, nearly landing on all four paws. More proof that he shouldn’t be a warrior. Why couldn’t those fox-hearts just let him do what he was good at?!
_Whisperpaw tried the move over and over, but it always ended in disaster. Every time he was too slow. Sometimes he was unprepared, and he couldn’t even drop into a crouch. Other times he’d not even try to crouch and just flop over onto his side. But most times, he’d be in the middle of rolling when Snowyshine planted a paw on his neck, having been too slow to get all the way onto his paws before his mentor landed.
_“Whisperpaw,” Snowyshine mewed as her apprentice caught his breath after another failed attempt. “I don’t think you’re really trying.”
_Whisperpaw stared at his mentor. All the misery and hurt that had been gathering in his heart for the past half moon exploded out at once.
_“You don’t think I’m trying?!” Whisperpaw spat. The other cats around him stopped their training to stare at him, but he no longer cared what they did. “I’ve been trying really hard to learn this move! How am I supposed to move any faster?!”
_“Whisperpaw-” Snowyshine tried to interrupt.
_“I’ve been moving as fast as I can!” Whisperpaw screeched. “I’m not good at moving fast, or climbing, or fighting, or hunting! I’m good at healing, and herbs, and medicine cat stuff! I should be training to be a medicine cat apprentice!” the pale gray apprentice’s yowl broke away into whimpers. “It’s not fair. It isn’t right, and it’s not fair. Why can’t you fox-hearts just let me do what I’m good at?”
_“You don’t know that you won’t be a good warrior.” Snowyshine mewed. Whisperpaw glared up at her, his pale blue eyes filled with a crazed look of hurt. She didn’t understand. Darkshadow came and stepped over to Snowyshine’s side. They didn’t understand.
_Suddenly, Whisperpaw’s rage and hurt vanished into a void of emptiness. He didn’t care what they did or said anymore. The whole forest could burn to bits around him and he wouldn’t care. He let himself fall onto the ground with a thud. They didn’t care. They didn't understand. They didn’t care enough to understand. All was hopeless.


/


_The rain had lightened to a misty drizzle as Whisperpaw trailed along behind the other cats. Sunset had past and the sky was dark. Dark and miserable, just how he felt. Rustlepaw and Tawnypaw tried to comfort him, but he just hissed at them to leave him alone. Nobody understood. Not even his littermates. But at least they cared… 
_As they walked along toward camp, Whisperpaw was left farther and farther behind until the figures of the other cats were lost in the hazy blueness of the mist. Alone at last, he felt a lot better. No more careless enthusiastic fox-hearts. Now it was just him and the darkening forest.
_Whisperpaw walked slower and slower, enjoying the cool mist on his pelt. It seemed to cool the ache in his heart. It was a little cold, but he was fine. He thought of the burnet he’d left behind on the way to battle training. He couldn’t go and get it, since it was on the other side of Wide-River. Whisperpaw shuddered at the thought of crossing the Fallen-Oak. He might not be able to get that bit of burnet, but he could look for other herbs.
_The pale gray apprentice continued along Wide-River’s bank until, almost halfway from the Fallen-Oak to camp, he reached a place where the river turned down-hill. From there, he turned in the direction of the Twoleg Territory border, the border with the unnatural silver-wall. He knew that about a third of the way to that border there were a few juniper bushes. Those would be good for Eaglewing’s cough. Also good for bellyaches.
_As Whisperpaw walked, he smelled a tangy scent through the fresh wetness of the mist. He followed the scent between two bramble bushes, where he saw a herb with very tiny leaves. He remembered this herb. What was it called? Thyme, he thought. Dreamheart had given a sprig of it to Shimmerstone to calm her down after she’d attacked Duskstorm.
_Whisperpaw picked up a few sprigs of thyme. He would have liked to pick more, but the plant was so small due to the constant shade of the bramble bushes. With the thyme securely in his jaws, he continued walking.
_Whisperpaw had only gone a couple paces when the mist densened in front of him. The mist gathered into a cat-like shape, and a starry outline materialized before him. Golden eyes opened, gazing wisely down at the gray-furred apprentice. The mist-cat glowed against the darkness of the night, her bright blue misty pelt lighting up the trees around them.
_That was the StarClan cat that had saved him, Whisperpaw realized. He stared stunned as the mist-furred stary she-cat opened her mouth to speak.
_“You know your destiny.” The StarClan cat told him. And with that, her starry outline faded away into the mist, leaving Whisperpaw alone again in the dark.
_Misery and sadness flooded over him. He let the thyme slip out of his mouth and drop onto the ground. Whisperpaw stared into the darkness of the trees. He did know his destiny. He was destined to be a warrior for the rest of his life.




































Missing Whispers
_Tawnypaw was the first to notice that Whisperpaw was missing. She looked at the trees behind her, but she couldn’t spot the pale gray pelt of her brother.
_“Whisperpaw’s gone!” Tawnypaw mewed to the other three cats.
_“Whisperpaw!” Darkshadow called. “Whisperpaw, where are you?!”
_There was no response.
_“Whisperpaw!” Tawnypaw called, going in the direction they came from. Whisperpaw had been lagging behind. Maybe he was just really really far behind. Worry ached in her chest as she searched. What if a badger or a fox had got him?! What if- No, Tawnypaw told herself, calming down. It wasn’t very likely that anything would have attacked him in the short time he’d gone. Besides, Whisperpaw could climb trees, even if he was terrified of it.
_The four cats searched and searched, but they couldn’t find Whisperpaw. Tawnypaw glanced at the sky, wondering how long they’d been searching. The nearly full moon had just risen above the edge of the sky.
_“I think we should go back to camp now.” Snowyshine mewed. But what about Whisperpaw?!
_“But we can’t give up looking for Whisperpaw!” Rustlepaw hissed, echoing Tawnypaw’s thoughts.
_“But if we don’t go back soon,” Darkshadow pointed out. “Sorrelstar might send a patrol to look for us.”
_“But we can’t give up now!” Rustlepaw wailed, his green eyes full of fear for his brother. “We have to find him, don’t we Tawnypaw?!”
_Three pairs of eyes turned to Tawnypaw. She stared back at them. What should she say? Probably just what she thought.
_“It’s true that the clan will worry about us,” Tawnypaw began. “But we can’t leave Whisperpaw wandering around alone all night. What will he eat? Where will he sleep?”
_“He’ll probably just come back to camp on his own.” Snowyshine mewed, and turned to go in the direction of camp.
_“You mean you’re willing to let my brother wander around all night, where he might get lost and have foxes and badgers attack him?!” Rustlepaw spat. Snowyshine flinched under the fury in his forest green eyes.
_“But we’re getting nowhere with the search.” Darkshadow complained. “If we haven’t found him yet, we probably aren’t going to find him at all.”
_While the other cats were busy arguing, Tawnypaw was thinking. How could they find Whisperpaw? They hadn’t seen him anywhere, and they had no idea where he might go. They couldn’t even smell a whiff of his scent.
_“His scent!” Tawnypaw exclaimed, interrupting one of Rustlepaw’s fearful rants. “We can find his scent trail!
_Snowyshine and Darkshadow exchanged guilty and embarrassed looks. Tawnypaw felt a bit of satisfaction that the experienced warriors hadn’t thought of that obvious idea.
_“But where will we find his scent trail?” Darkshadow asked.
_“I think I know where.” Tawnypaw answered. “Follow me.”
_“Wait!” Tawnypaw stopped, turning to Snowyshine.
_“I’ll go back and tell the clan what’s going on.” Snowyshine mewed.
_The other cats nodded and set off, following Tawnypaw. Tawnypaw led them to where they had first noticed that Whisperpaw was missing. If Whisperpaw had been lagging so far behind that he was just left behind, they could go back the way they came along the river until they found his scent trail.
_Tawnypaw walked along, Darkshadow and Rustlepaw just behind her. She hoped her plan worked. She couldn’t leave Whisperpaw alone all night. He was… a bit of a scaredy-mouse, Tawnypaw admitted to herself. He was terrified of falling, drowning… and being lost.
_The brown-tinged orange she-cat started to move faster, almost running. Whisperpaw wouldn’t survive out in the forest alone! He might be lost! What if a fox came and he was too scared to climb a tree?! Or a badger came and chased him into a river?! Leaving him alone out there surrounded by his fears would be cruel, as fox-hearted as abandoning a defenseless cat in the same den as Shiverpaw and her sisters. Tawnypaw’s worried green eyes filled with determination. She would find her brother.
_Tawnypaw raced through the forest. The nearly full moon lit up the trees, so she could avoid them. But the ground remained dark. She stepped on several stones, and she could smell the tang of her blood in the air. But that wasn’t important. What was important was finding Whisperpaw.
_Suddenly, the ground seemed to vanish beneath Tawnypaw’s paws. Freezing water surrounded her legs. As her paws hit the stones beneath the water, they slid sideways, unable to get a grip on the slippery rocks. Tawnypaw fell over into the water.
_Coldness surrounded her, and she hit the stones below her with a splash. The impact hurt, but at least the stones weren’t sharp. Luckily, the water was only a tail-length high there, so Tawnypaw could easily lift her head above the surface.
_Blinking water from her eyes, Tawnypaw dragged herself out of the river and across the muddy pebble covered ground toward her brother and her mentor.
_“We’ve found Whisperpaw’s scent!” Rustlepaw announced. Tawnypaw padded over to him, shaking water from her pelt. At first she couldn’t smell anything through the mud on her fur, but then she just barely picked up her brother’s familiar scent.
_Darkshadow led the way at a quick pace, following Whisperpaw’s scent trail. Tawnypaw and Rustlepaw walked closely behind. Tawnypaw shivered. Water and mud made her orange and brown fur hang in dripping muddy clumps. The air was freezing, its coldness seeping into her bones. Shivering, Tawnypaw pressed closer to her brother. Rustlepaw however, did not want Tawnypaw’s drenched pelt to get him wet and cold as well, so he moved away.
_They walked for a while in a straight line towards the border with the Twoleg Territory. Finally, they saw the silver-wall that marked the boundary. Whisperpaw’s scent trail turned left from there, and along the BirchClan border. The scent of BirchClan was so strong it almost completely hid Whisperpaw’s scent. But Tawnypaw could still smell it. She would find her brother.
_It was just past moonhigh when Tawnypaw noticed a pale figure, far ahead of her. She broke into a run, Rustlepaw keeping up just behind even with his twisted leg. She was getting closer and closer…
_Whisperpaw’s ears pricked, and he began to run. He must have thought Tawnypaw was a fox!
_“Wait!” Tawnypaw called to her brother. “It’s me! Tawnypaw!”
_Whisperpaw suddenly stopped, turning around. Tawnypaw was moving so fast, she barely managed to stop herself from crashing into him. Rustlepaw stopped beside Tawnypaw, Darkshadow following behind them.
_“Whisperpaw!” Rustlepaw purred. “Where were you?! We’ve been looking for you since sunset!”
_“S-Sorry.” Whisperpaw mewed guiltily around the mouthful of herbs he was holding. He was holding so many herbs that they were falling out of his mouth!
_“Let me carry me carry some of those herbs for you.” Tawnypaw offered. Whisperpaw purred thankfully and Tawnypaw picked up some of the herbs. They tasted horrible and bitter, but she knew that they would be useful to help sick cats through the cold seasons.
_“Whisperpaw!” Darkshadow scolded when he reached them. “What were you thinking?!”
_“I thought I’d get some herbs for the clan!” Whisperpaw mumbled through the mouthful of leaves and stems in his mouth.
_“But why should you get herbs?” Darkshadow asked. “You’re not a medicine cat!”
_Whisperpaw opened his mouth to argue, but a miserable look appeared in his eyes.
_“You’re right.” He mewed, his voice so quiet it could barely be heard above the rushing of the wind. “I’ll never be a medicine cat.”


/


_Tawnypaw followed Darkshadow, Woodstep, and Snowyshine through the forest. Water glistened on the trees, the warm sunlight cooled by early leaf-fall winds. The rain from the night before had stopped, but the trees were too wet for new apprentices to climb. The sun shone out from an almost cloudless sky, lighting up the leaves. If it wasn’t for the cold icy breeze, Tawnypaw would’ve thought it was green-leaf.
_“Today,” Darkshadow mewed. “We will be practicing ground-hunting.”
_Tawnypaw had learned how to hunt on the ground, but she hadn’t caught anything yet. She couldn’t wait to catch her first piece of fresh-kill! Whisperpaw stared dully at the ground. He was still sad about not being able to become a medicine cat apprentice. Shiverpaw sat a fox-length away. So far, Shiverpaw hadn’t done anything to Tawnypaw or her littermates, but Tawnypaw didn’t trust her.
_“Each of you will hunt prey,” Snowyshine mewed. “And we’ll watch from the trees. Let’s see who can catch the most prey!”
_Tawnypaw dashed off excitedly into the forest, before slowing down. If she ran around, she’d scare all of the prey! She lifted her nose to scent the air. She could smell something delicious… A mouse!
_Her paws itched to run toward the scent, but Tawnypaw forced herself to drop into a crouch and slink silently through the undergrowth toward the scent. The smell got stronger as she got closer. Finally, just behind a leafy bush, she could see a bit of brown fur.
_Tawnypaw crept forward until she was only a tail-length away, making sure not to step on any twigs. A gust of wind burst from behind her. The wind! Tawnypaw had forgotten to stay downwind!
_The mouse turned its head toward Tawnypaw, its eyes opened wide. The mouse turned and ran, but Tawnypaw pushed off from the ground, aiming to smash her paws down on the mouse’s neck. But instead she landed just behind it. Quickly, she lunged forward and knocked the mouse over with a paw. Finally, she bit down hard on the mouse’s neck.
_Tawnypaw stared down at the lifeless mouse. Her first piece of fresh-kill! Tawnypaw was so excited that she’d killed the mouse that she didn’t notice the cat lurking through the shadows behind her…
_All Tawnypaw smelled was a whiff of cat-scent before paws shoved her into the leafy bush where she had found her mouse. She whipped around, ready to claw the other cat’s face, but her sprained paw burst with pain. The other cat used her distraction the knock Tawnypaw over and plant a paw on her neck.
_Cold blue eyes stared down at her, two bright ovals of leaf-bare ice, gleaming with hatred. Claws pricked at Tawnypaw’s neck. Her heart stopped beating.
_“Shiverpaw…” Tawnypaw was so scared she couldn’t even shudder with fear. “Wh-What do y-you w-w-want?!”
_Shiverpaw stared back down at her, coldness in her eyes. All was silent. All was still. Even the wind had stopped. The terrifying silver she-cat stared deep into Tawnypaw’s leaf green eyes. It was almost as if she were looking for something, something she just couldn’t find. The look in Shiverpaw’s blue eyes intensified into some sort of rage.
_“Rouge!” Shiverpaw finally screeched. “Filthy rouge with no place in ForestClan!”
_Claws pressed down on Tawnypaw’s neck, and she didn’t dare to breathe. Shiverpaw’s whole body shook with fury as she glared down at the orange-brown apprentice. One swift strike across the neck and Tawnypaw would be dead. She knew she should be panicking, but something inside her told her that Shiverpaw wouldn’t kill her.
_“Rouge!” Shiverpaw spat suddenly, before grabbing Tawnypaw’s mouse and darting away.
_Tawnypaw got slowly to her paws, shock setting in. Shiverpaw had attacked her! Shiverpaw had taken Tawnypaw’s first piece of fresh-kill! Anger glowed in Tawnypaw’s eyes. That thief would pay for what she’d done! But not yet.
_The brown tinged she-cat licked the mud off of her fur, and stepped slowly out of the bush. Her sprained paw hurt, but otherwise she was unharmed. But Tawnypaw knew that Shiverpaw would attack again, and next time, she might not be so lucky.










Longing to Fly
_Ivypaw carried her vole through the forest back to the willow tree Duskstorm had instructed her to meet at. The sunhigh sun shone down from the top of the cloudless sky. Soon the trees would be dry. Climbing practice would start again!
_The black and white she-cat blinked. Why was she excited? The clan still hated her. Nobody cared about her. And climbing was boring, she told herself. Climbing was repetitive and too difficult. What was so exciting about staring down from the treetops and being able to see forever… Ivypaw shook herself. She did not find that fun. Maybe a little bit…
_ForestClan still hated Ivypaw and her littermates. All the time in camp, cats would call her names and insult her. She found the time out of the camp training with cats that didn’t seem to hate her a relief. And maybe she did find climbing fun, though she would never admit it. But still, there was Shiverpaw, the older apprentices, Sparrowflight, Stalkingleaf, and most of the clan to be horrible to her. Ivypaw sighed miserably. It didn’t matter that climbing was fun, and hunting was a little exciting. Whenever she had a single joyful thought, reality would come back to her. Her entire clan hated her and there was nothing she could do about it.
_Ivypaw arrived at the willow tree. Rustlepaw was already there, looking proudly down at a pair of dead mice. Ivypaw dropped her vole nearby, kind of sad that she hadn’t got as much prey as her brother. Her brother had a crippled leg and he had gotten more prey than she had! Though she had come very close to catching that mouse… But Ivypaw had missed it. She was always destined to be a failure.
_“Rustlepaw, you caught two mice!” Duskstorm exclaimed. Ivypaw sunk deeper into misery. “That’s a lot of fresh-kill for your first time hunting real prey!”
_“Well you’re a good mentor!” Rustlepaw purred back, giving his brown tabby pelt a lick.
_“And Ivypaw,” Glistenfern added. “That vole looks very tasty! I’m sure the elders will enjoy it!”
_The elders wouldn’t enjoy Ivypaw’s prey. They’d say it tasted like crow-food because a “rogue” caught it. And Ivypaw had missed that mouse…
_Seeing the sad look in Ivypaw’s forest green eyes, the golden tinged she-cat came over to her side. What was she going to say? Probably something bad, Ivypaw decided. A lot of the cats in the clan seemed nice, but they were really just as mean as the rest of the clan. The black and white apprentice turned away, not wanting to hear anymore insults.
_“Ivypaw,” Glistenfern mewed softly, stopping her with a paw. “It’s okay that you didn’t bring back as much prey as Rustlepaw.”
_Ivypaw looked back at Glistenfern with a startled look in her eyes. No cat besides her littermates had ever been nice to her before. There were a few cats that weren’t mean, but never any that were actually kind to her.
_Glistenfern looked down at Ivypaw with a caring look in her forest green eyes. Forest green eyes… a caring look… Memories came rushing back to Ivypaw, so vivid they startled her. Her mother’s caring green eyes… The feel of her fluffy fur… Brown, orange-brown… 


/


_The mouse was just tail-lengths away. But Ivypaw knew she would miss this one. Just like the last three… Glistenfern and Duskstorm had told Rustlepaw and Ivypaw to practice ground-hunting for the rest of the day. And so far, she’d missed two more mice.
_Ivypaw was so close to the mouse, but she knew she wouldn’t be able to catch it. She’d either step on a twig, or misjudge how far she should pounce, or forget to stay downwind… Ivypaw let her tail drop against the ground in her misery. The mouse darted away, hearing the sound.
_A brownish cat leaped out of the undergrowth, pinning the mouse down. Tawnypaw turned to look at her sister, the mouse hanging limply from her jaws.
_“Ivypaw!” Tawnypaw exclaimed, surprised to see her sister.
_“Hi, Tawnypaw…” Ivypaw mumbled. A fourth mouse she’d missed. Tawnypaw buried the mouse in the ground.
_“Shiverpaw attacked me.” Tawnypaw mewed. Ivypaw’s eyes opened wide with horror. And she’d thought things couldn’t get any worse…
_“That fox-heart stole my mouse!” Tawnypaw growled, her forest green eyes full of anger. “My first piece of fresh-kill! She ended up with three pieces of fresh-kill, while I only got one! Our mentors think that she's going to be one of the best hunters in the clan! That lying thief!”
_“Ivypaw,” Tawnypaw mewed, calming down. “What did you catch?”
_“A vole.” Ivypaw answered,  staring at the ground.
_“It’s okay that you only caught a vole.” Tawnypaw gave her sister a lick on the shoulder. “It is only our first time hunting.”
_“But I’ve missed four mice!” Ivypaw wailed, clawing a pawful of grass from the ground. “And I only caught that vole because it got stuck in a bramble bush! I’m horrible at hunting! I’m a useless failure!”
_“Ivypaw,” Tawnypaw stared into her sister’s identical leaf green eyes. “Maybe it will be easier to hunt if you believe in yourself.”
_Tawnypaw gave her sister a few licks to smooth her pelt, before walking away to continue hunting. Ivypaw was left staring blankly into the trees. Believe in herself? How could a failure like her believe in herself?


/


_Ivypaw dismally carried a single mouse back to camp, the sky turned orange with the sunset. A single mouse. Only one. She looked over at Rustlepaw who carried two voles and a mouse. Tawnypaw and Shiverpaw each had five pieces of prey! And Ivypaw only had one single scrawny mouse.
_And Ivypaw wasn’t the only one who had noticed that.
_“Silverkit, look!” Shiverpaw exclaimed, a look of cruelty in her icy blue eyes. “Uselesspaw’s only caught one mouse!”
_“She must be so useless!” Silverkit mewed when Shiverpaw turned to glare at her.
_“She’s so useless even Crippledpaw’s caught more prey than her!” Hazekit mewed loudly, attracting Rosepaw and Thornpaw’s attention. Ivypaw could feel herself shrinking beneath her pelt. She turned to go into the apprentices’ den, but Rosepaw ran in front of her, stopping her.
_“Where do you think you’re going?” the light brown tabby she-cat hissed. Ivypaw let out a whimper and stepped backward, only to run into Thornpaw.
_“Scared?!” the gray tom snarled. Ivypaw turned to run away, but found Shiverpaw glaring at her, Silverkit and Hazekit just behind her.
_“Coward!” Shiverpaw spat, before turning to look at Silverkit. When she stayed silent, Shiverpaw smacked her sister with a paw.
_“Cowardly rouge!” Silverkit hissed reluctantly.
_“Uselesspaw, you’re such a cowardly weakling that you’re scared of the mice!” Hazekit yowl, looking fearfully to Shiverpaw for approval. Shiverpaw nodded, and Hazekit continued.
_“That’s why you only caught one mouse!” the pale gray she-cat screeched. “And that one probably died out of pity for such a weak, useless, cowardly kit!”
_No matter how many times Ivypaw was insulted, each one stung with the same pain as before. But today it hurt more than usual because Ivypaw knew that what they were saying was true. She really was useless.


/


_Ivypaw trailed behind Rustlepaw and their mentors. She was useless. She couldn’t hunt. At least they were doing climbing training today and not ground hunting. Climbing training was boring, she forced herself to think. But Ivypaw couldn’t deny the slight spring of excitement in her steps. Maybe she did like climbing, she admitted to herself.
_A drop of water hit the sleek white fur on Ivypaw’s back. No. Another drop splashed down, followed by a few more. As the rain thickened, so did the dismal feeling in her heart. Only then did she realize how much she wanted to climb.
_Duskstorm stopped to look up at the graying sky. Glistenfern and Rustlepaw followed his gaze, but Ivypaw just stared at the ground as she descended deeper into misery. She only had one thing she enjoyed. One little spark of hope that was now being washed away with the rain. The emptiness that flooded over Ivypaw was so horrible she just barely stopped herself from wailing in despair. Why did the one she wanted have to be taken away from her?! Why did her hopes have to be raised, only to be ripped apart like a piece of prey?!
_Ivypaw stared up into the clouds, wishing with all her heart that the rain would just go away. The sky, where StarClan was. Her eyes filled with anger. StarClan was supposed to watch over the clans, and yet they were letting her suffer like this! They must hate her because she was a useless cowardly rouge! And they were right.
_The rain started to stop, the clouds clearing away. The sun shone down directly at Ivypaw from between two branches, lighting her up while the rest of the forest was lost in shadow. The anger and sadness in Ivypaw’s heart faded to be replaced with a calmness and certainty she’d never felt before. StarClan did care about her. She would get to climb. It didn’t matter that she was a horrible hunter. Everything would be okay.

_“Today we’ll learn how to jump from tree to tree!” Glistenfern mewed, bounding up a young oak and stopping by the lowest branch. Ivypaw watched intently, memorising every detail. She could imagine the joy of jumping from branch to branch with ease, but she could just as easily imagine falling dozens of fox-length to the ground. She wanted to learn to climb safely.
_“Before going onto any branch,” Glistenfern instructed. “Test the branch with a paw to make sure it isn’t dead or rotting. Dead branches will break beneath your weight. You should also avoid branches that are too small.”
_Glistenfern batted at the branch with a paw, before scrambling up onto it. A birch tree was next to her, one of its branches only a couple tail-lengths away.
_“Don’t jump to branches that are more than a cat-length away, unless you really really have to.” Glistenfern told the two apprentices. “Only jump to branches that look strong enough not to break from the impact of you landing on the branch. Does this branch look strong enough?”
_Ivypaw studied the birch branch. It was about a tail-length thick, almost as thick as the one Glistenfern was currently standing on. It might bend a bit when she landed, but it wouldn’t break.
_“Yes.” Ivypaw answered, Rustlepaw echoing her. Glistenfern and Duskstorm nodded in agreement.
_“To know if the branch is dead or not,” Glistenfern continued. “You can just see whether or not it has any leaves growing on it.”
_“Now both of you try it!” Duskstorm mewed.
_Ivypaw bounded over to a maple tree and ran up the trunk, forgetting her misery. She whacked the first branch she reached, just like Glistenfern had. When the maple branch stayed firm, she scrambled up onto it. In front of her and just a tail-length below was the branch of a small oak tree. Yellowing leaves grew from the branch, and though the branch was pretty small, Ivypaw was sure it could hold her weight.
_Ivypaw leaped, aiming to land on the branch. The branch sank beneath her, and she dug her claws into the bark, afraid she was going to fall, but the branch didn’t break. She slowly walked forward toward the tree’s trunk. She’d done it! She’d jumped to another tree!
_Now that Ivypaw knew how to climb and jump from branch to branch, she could go anywhere! She flung herself onto the nearby branch of a birch and dashed up its trunk. Reaching a higher branch, she hit it with her paw and climbed up onto it when it stayed firm.
_The ground seemed pretty far below her, but Ivypaw wasn’t scared. Instead she was amazed by how small everything was, how far she could see. But still, the trees rose high up around her, blocking her view. Ivypaw had never dared to go higher than how high up she was then, but the feel of the wind and the sky called to her, urging her to go higher. Her paws tingled to run through the branches. Pushing back her fears, Ivypaw started to run.
_Ivypaw leaped from branch to branch, running up tree trunks so fast she barely had to dig her claws into the bark. The wind rushed past her and she could feel the speed of her claws as she climbed. She went higher and higher. She was all alone now. No Shiverpaw. No Rosepaw and Thornpaw. Nobody to be mean to her. Nobody to call her names. Just her and the trees.
_Time went by in a blur. Her legs ached. Her chest heaved. But she couldn’t stop climbing. Something urged her to climb, to go higher and higher…
_Ivypaw raced up a tree trunk. When she started getting close to the top, she scrambled up onto a branch and ran along it, ready to jump into the tree next to her… She stopped just tail-lengths away from the end of the branch, shocked by what she saw.
_Trees stretched out far below her in all directions, their bright green color a beautiful contrast to the blood red light of the setting sun. Clouds glowed pink in the sky, which rose high above her.
_Ivypaw sat there calmly, enjoying the cool breeze as the sun set. The forest below her seemed to go on forever, tree after tree. She longed to explore it, leaping from branch to branch, no ForestClan to be mean to her. Just her and the trees. But she could never leave ForestClan. It was the only life she had ever known. She was trapped, a bird with a broken wing, longing to fly…
_The final rays of red light disappeared, leaving Ivypaw alone in the night. It was time to go back, back to her miserable life. Where dreams were just dreams, never to be had.




















































?
_Rustlepaw watched as Ivypaw dashed over to a maple tree, glad that his sister was having fun for once. Glistenfern hastened to follow, climbing swiftly up the tree trunk a few fox-lengths behind her apprentice. Ready to learn, Rustlepaw ran over to a birch and began to climb.
_Rustlepaw moved one paw up at a time, dragging his twisted leg behind him. Duskstorm followed behind him. When Rustlepaw reached the first branch, he tested it with a paw before climbing onto it. Nearby was the branch of a young pine.
_The branch was only half a cat-length away, but Rustlepaw had never been good at jumping. He couldn’t use much force on his twisted hind leg, so he only had one leg to use to jump. But whenever he tried to jump using that leg, he would only be able to move two tail-lengths and the jump would be unstable. But Rustlepaw wasn’t going to give up! If he practiced jumping on the ground where it was safer, he’d be able to jump from branch to branch in the trees!
_Rustlepaw told his mentor his plan and climbed back down to the ground.

[aq]It said earlier the cats were watching the tom fall in the puddle.  How did manage to hide?
[ar]There should be a sentence saying the tom managed to elude.  Then if he did, why didn't he simply run away.  Oh, he wanted to scare them, not just run away!
[as]It mentions earlier that if he tries to run away, they'd follow his scent trail and he doesn't want that to happen.
[at]Wouldn't it be completely dark in there, or was there a source of light from somewhere?
[au]There's some amount of light that's there somehow. I don't know.
[av]Sleepykit is my favorite kit.  I hardly remember any other kits except Ivykit
[aw]Sleepykit is a name Silverkit called Ivykit.
[ax]I like how your story builds up tension here, with the rogue kits as undercats that the reader can start to root for.   Wait I thought, pigs root.
[ay]I like how this makes these feral cats somewhat like vampires
[az]Beautiful moment.  Made me cry. Honest.
