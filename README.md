# structure-editor-old

This is a tool I made a while ago for loading structures into vanilla Minecraft worlds using chained structure blocks. It's a bit clunky and was made before I had much of an idea of how asynchronous JavaScript works. Try it out if you're interested, but don't expect it to work particularly well.
